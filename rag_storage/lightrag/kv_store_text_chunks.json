Most of these are mixtures containing two or more pure substances. Their utility or importance in life depends on their composition. For example, the properties of brass (mixture of copper and zinc) are quite different from those of German silver (mixture of copper, zinc and nickel) or bronze (mixture of copper and tin); 1 part per million (ppm) of fluoride ions in water prevents tooth decay, while $1 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { p p m }$ causes the tooth to become mottled and high concentrations of fluoride ions can be poisonous (for example, sodium fluoride is used in rat poison); intravenous injections are always dissolved in water containing salts at particular ionic concentrations that match with blood plasma concentrations and so on. \n\nIn this Unit, we will consider mostly liquid solutions and their formation. This wil be followed by studying the properties of the solutions, like vapour pressure and colligative properties. We will begin with types of solutions and then various alternatives in which concentrations of a solute can be expressed in liquid solution. \n\nSolutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more than two components. By homogenous mixture we mean that its composition and properties are uniform throughout the mixture. Generally, the component that is present in the largest quantity is known as solvent. Solvent determines the physical state in which solution exists. One or more components present in the solution other than solvent are called solutes. In this Unit we shall consider only binary solutions (i.e., consisting of two components). Here each component may be solid, liquid or in gaseous state and are summarised in Table 1.1. \n\nComposition of a solution can be described by expressing its concentration. The latter can be expressed either qualitatively or quantitatively. For example, qualitatively we can say that the solution is dilute (i.e., relatively very small quantity of solute) or it is concentrated (i.e., relatively very large quantity of solute). But in real life these kinds of description can add to lot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description of the solution. \n\nThere are several ways by which we can describe the concentration of the solution quantitatively. \n\n(i) Mass percentage (w/w): The mass percentage of a component of a solution is defined as: Mass $\\%$ of a component \n\nFor example, if a solution is described by $1 0 \\%$ glucose in water by mass, it means that $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of glucose is dissolved in $9 0 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ of water resulting in a $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ solution. Concentration described by mass percentage is commonly used in industrial chemical applications. For example, commercial bleaching solution contains 3.62 mass percentage of sodium hypochlorite in water. \n\n(ii) Volume percentage $( V / V )$ : The volume percentage is defined as: Volume $\\%$ of a component $=$ Volume of the component ×100 Total volume of solution \n\nFor example, $1 0 \\%$ ethanol solution in water means that $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { \\ m L }$ of ethanol is dissolved in water such that the total volume of the solution is $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m L } }$ .

Solutions containing liquids are commonly expressed in this unit. For example, a $3 5 \\% ~ ( v / v )$ solution of ethylene glycol, an antifreeze, is used in cars for cooling the engine.

It depends upon the nature of solute and solvent as well as temperature and pressure. Let us consider the effect of these factors in solution of a solid or a gas in a liquid. \n\n1.3.1 Solubility of a Solid in a Liquid \n\nEvery solid does not dissolve in a given liquid. while sodium chloride and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do not. On the other hand, naphthalene and anthracene dissolve readily in benzene but sodium chloride and sugar do not. It is observed that polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents and non polar solutes in nonpolar solvents. In general, a solute dissolves in a solvent if the intermolecular interactions are similar in the two or we may say like dissolves like. \n\nwhen a solid solute is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves and its concentration increases in solution. This process is known as dissolution. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute particles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as crystallisation. A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the same rate. Under such conditions, number of 'solute particles going into solution will be equal to the solute particles separating out and a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached. \n\nSolute $^ +$ Solvent Solution \n\nAt this stage the concentration of solute in solution will remain constant under the given conditions, i.e., temperature and pressure. Similar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents. Such a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature and pressure is called a saturated solution. An unsaturated solution is one in which more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium with undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the maximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent. Thus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility. \n\nEarlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into another depends on the nature of the substances. In addition to these variables, two other parameters, i.e., temperature and pressure also control this phenomenon. \n\nEffect of temperature \n\nThe solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature changes.

Consider the equilibrium represented by equation 1.10. This, being dynamic equilibrium, must follow Le Chateliers Principle. In general, if in a nearly saturated solution, the dissolution process is endothermic $( \\Delta _ { \\mathrm { s o l } } \\ \\mathrm { ~ H ~ } > \\ 0 )$ , the solubility should increase with rise in temperature and if it is exothermic $( \\Delta _ { \\mathrm { s o l } } \\ \\mathrm { H } < 0 )$ the solubility should decrease. These trends are also observed experimentally. \n\nEffect of pressure \n\nPressure does not have any significant effect on solubility of solids in liquids. It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible and practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure. \n\n1.3.2 Solubility of a Gas in a Liquid \n\nMany gases dissolve in water. Oxygen dissolves only to a small extent in water. It is this dissolved oxygen which sustains all aquatic life. On the other hand, hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) is highly soluble in water. Solubility of gases in liquids is greatly affected by pressure and temperature. The solubility of gases increase with increase of pressure. For solution of gases in a solvent, consider a system as shown in Fig. 1.1 (a). The lower part is solution and the upper part is gaseous system at pressure $p$ and temperature $T .$ Assume this system to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of gaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same. Now increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the gas to a smaller volume [Fig. 1.1 (b)]. This will increase the number of gaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate at which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to enter it. The solubility of the gas will increase until a new equilibrium is reached resulting in an increase in the pressure of a gas above the solution and thus its solubility increases. \n\nHenry was the first to give a quantitative relation between pressure and solubility of a gas in a solvent which is known as Henry's law. The law states that at a constant temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas present above the surface of liquid or solution. Dalton, a contemporary of Henry, also concluded independently that the solubility of a gas in a liquid solution is a function of partial pressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in the solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be said that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over the solution. The most commonly used form of Henry's law states that \"the partial pressure of the gas in vapour phase $\\pmb { \\left[ p \\right] }$ is proportional to the mole fraction of the gas $\\pmb { \\left\\{ x \\right\\} }$ in the solution\" and is expressed as: \n\nHere $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ is the Henry's law constant. If we draw a graph between partial pressure of the gas versus mole fraction of the gas in solution, then we should get a plot of the type as shown in Fig. 1.2. \n\nDifferent gases have different $K _ { \\",

This suggests that $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ is a function of the nature of the gas. \n\nIt is obvious from equation (1.11) that higher the value of $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ at a given pressure, the lower is the solubility of the gas in the liquid. It can be seen from Table 1.2 that $\\mathrm { K } _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ values for both $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { { O } } _ { 2 }$ increase with increase of temperature indicating that the solubility of gases increases with decrease of temperature. It is due to this reason that aquatic species are more comfortable in cold waters rather than in warm waters. - \n\nExample 1.4 $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ gas is bubbled through water at $2 9 3 \\ \\mathrm { K }$ , how many millimoles of $\\mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ gas would dissolve in 1 litre of water?

Notable among these are: \n\n• To increase the solubility of $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in soft drinks and soda water, the bottle is sealed under high pressure. • Scuba divers must cope with high concentrations of dissolved gases while breathing air at high pressure underwater. Increased pressure increases the solubility of atmospheric gases in blood. when the divers come towards surface, the pressure gradually decreases. This releases the dissolved gases and leads to the formation of bubbles of nitrogen in the blood. This blocks capillaries and creates a medical condition known as bends, which are painful and dangerous to life. \n\nTo avoid bends, as well as, the toxic effects of high concentrations of nitrogen in the blood, the tanks used by scuba divers are filled with air diluted with helium $. 1 1 . 7 \\%$ helium, $5 6 . 2 \\%$ nitrogen and $3 2 . 1 \\%$ oxygen). \n\n• At high altitudes the partial pressure of oxygen is less than that at the ground level. This leads to low concentrations of oxygen in the blood and tissues of people living at high altitudes or climbers. Low blood oxygen causes climbers to become weak and unable to think clearly, symptoms of a condition known as anoxia. \n\nEffect of Temperature \n\nSolubility of gases in liquids decreases with rise in temperature. when dissolved, the gas molecules are present in liquid phase and the process of dissolution can be considered similar to condensation and heat is evolved in this process. We have learnt in the last Section that dissolution process involves dynamic equilibrium and thus must follow Le Chatelier's Principle. As dissolution is an exothermic process, the solubility should decrease with increase of temperature. \n\nIntexct Questions \n\n1.6 ${ \\mathrm { H } } _ { 2 } { \\mathsf { S } } _ { \\mathsf { \\ell } }$ , a toxic gas with rotten egg like smell, is used for the qualitative analysis.

We shall discuss the properties of only binary solutions, that is, the solutions containing two components, namely, the solutions of (i) liquids in liquids and (i) solids in liquids. \n\n1.4.1 Vapour Pressure of LiquidLiquid Solutions \n\nLet us consider a binary solution of two volatile liquids and denote the two components as 1 and 2. when taken in a closed vessel, both the components would evaporate and eventually an equilibrium would be established between vapour phase and the liquid phase. Let the total vapour pressure at this stage be $p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } }$ and $p _ { 1 }$ and $p _ { 2 }$ be the partial vapour pressures of the two components 1 and 2 respectively. These partial pressures are related to the mole fractions $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ of the two components 1 and 2 respectively. \n\nThe French chemist, Francois Marte Raoult (1886) gave the quantitative relationship between them. The relationship is known as the Raoult's law which states that for a solution of volatile liquids, the partial vapour pressure of each component of the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction present in solution. \n\nThus, for component 1 an $\\begin{array} { r l } & { p _ { 1 } \\propto x _ { 1 } } \\\\ { \\textrm { d } } & { p _ { 1 } = \\ p _ { 1 } ^ { 0 } \\ x _ { 1 } } \\end{array}$ \n\nwhere $p _ { 1 } ^ { 0 }$ is the vapour pressure of pure component 1 at the same temperature. \n\nSimilarly, for component 2 \n\nwhere ${ p _ { 2 } } ^ { 0 }$ represents the vapour pressure of the pure component 2. \n\nAccording to Dalton's law of partial pressures, the total pressure $( p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } } )$ over the solution phase in the container will be the sum of the partial pressures of the components of the solution and is given as: \n\nSubstituting the values of $p _ { 1 }$ and $p _ { 2 }$ , we get \n\nFollowing conclusions can be drawn from equation (1.16). \n\n(i) Total vapour pressure over the solution can be related to the mole fraction of any one component. \n\n(ii) Total vapour pressure over the solution varies linearly with the mole fraction of component 2. \n\n(ii) Depending on the vapour pressures of the pure components 1 and 2, total vapour pressure over the solution decreases or increases with the increase of the mole fraction of component 1. \n\nA plot of $p _ { 1 }$ or $p _ { 2 }$ versus the mole fractions $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ for a solution gives a linear plot as shown in Fig. 1.3. These lines (I and I) pass through the points for which $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ are equal to unity. Similarly the plot (line II) of $p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } }$ versus $x _ { 2 }$ is also linear (Fig. 1.3). The minimum value of $p _ { \\mathrm { t o",

Some physical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of pure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. Liquids at a given temperature vapourise and under equilibrium conditions the pressure exerted by the vapours of the liquid over the liquid phase is called vapour pressure [Fig. 1.4 (a)]. In 1a pure liquid the entire surface is occupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a non-volatile solute is added to a solvent to give a solution [Fig. 1.4.(b)], the vapour pressure of the solution is solely from the solvent alone. This vapour pressure of the solution at a given temperature is found to be lower than the vapour pressure of the pure solvent at the same temperature. In the solution, the surface has both solute and solvent molecules; thereby the fraction of the surface covered by the solvent molecules gets reduced. Consequently, the number of solvent molecules escaping from the surface is correspondingly reduced, thus, the vapour pressure is also reduced. \n\nThe decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the quantity of non-volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of its nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by adding $1 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }$ of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that produced by adding $1 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }$ of urea to the same quantity of water at the same temperature. \n\nRaoult's law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction. \n\nIn a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by 2. When the solute is non-volatile, only the solvent molecules are present in vapour phase and contribute to vapour pressure. Let $p _ { 1 }$ be the vapour pressure of the solvent, $x _ { 1 }$ be its mole fraction, ${ p } _ { \\mathrm { i } } ^ { 0 }$ be its vapour pressure in the pure state. Then according to Raoult's law \n\nThe proportionality constant is equal to the vapour pressure of pure solvent, $p _ { 1 } ^ { 0 }$ ; A plot between the vapour pressure and the mole fraction of the solvent is linear (Fig. 1.5). \n\n1.5 Ideal and Nonideal Solutions \n\n1.5.1 Ideal Solutions \n\nLiquid-liquid solutions can be classified into ideal and non-ideal solutions on the basis of Raoult's law. - \n\nThe solutions which obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration are known as ideal solutions. The ideal solutions have two other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the pure components to form the solution is zero and the volume of mixing is also zero, i.e., \n\nIt means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components are mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of volumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of the solutions can be explained by considering two components A and B. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will be of types A-A and B-B, whereas",

Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of volumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of the solutions can be explained by considering two components A and B. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will be of types A-A and B-B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition to these two interactions, A-B type of interactions will also be present. If the intermolecular attractive forces between the A-A and B-B are nearly equal to those between A-B, this leads to the formation of ideal solution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly ideal in behaviour. Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane, bromoethane and chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. fall into this category. \n\n1.5.2 Non-ideal Solutions \n\nWhen a solution does not obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration, then it is called non-ideal solution. The vapour pressure of such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by Raoult's law (equation 1.16). If it is higher, the solution exhibits positive deviation and if it is lower, it exhibits negative deviation from Raoult's law. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions for such solutions are shown in Fig. 1.6. \n\nThe cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the molecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult's law, A-B interactions are weaker than those between A-A or B-B, i.e., in this case the intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules are weaker than those between the solute-solute and solvent-solvent molecules. This means that in such solutions, molecules of A (or B) will find it easier to escape than in pure state. This will increase the vapour pressure and result in positive deviation. Mixtures of ethanol and acetone behave in this manner. In pure ethanol, molecules are hydrogen bonded. On adding acetone, its molecules get in between the host molecules and break some of the hydrogen bonds between them. Due to weakening of interactions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult's law [Fig. 1.6 (a)]. In a solution formed by adding carbon disulphide to acetone, the dipolar interactions between solute-solvent molecules are weaker than the respective interactions among the solute-solute and solvent-solvent molecules. This solution also shows positive deviation. \n\nIn case of negative deviations from Raoult's law, the intermolecular attractive forces between A-A and B-B are weaker than those between A-B and leads to decrease in vapour pressure resulting in negative deviations. An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline. In this case the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic proton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the respective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar molecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone forms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult's law. This is because chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen bond with acetone molecule as shown. \n\nThis decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each component and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting in negative deviation from Raoult's law [Fig. 1.6. (b)]. \n\nSome liquids on mixing, form azeotropes which are binary mixtures having the same composition in liquid and vapour phase and boil at a constant temperature. In such cases, it is not possible to separate the components by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes called minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling",

In such cases, it is not possible to separate the components by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes called minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling azeotrope. The solutions which show a large positive deviation from Raoult's law form minimum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. \n\nFor example, ethanol-water mixture (obtained by fermentation of sugars) on fractional distillation gives a solution containing approximately $9 5 \\%$ by volume of ethanol. Once this composition, known as azeotrope composition, has been achieved, the liquid and vapour have the same composition, and no further separation occurs. \n\nThe solutions that show large negative deviation from Raoult's law form maximum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. Nitric acid and water is an example of this class of azeotrope. This azeotrope has the approximate composition, $6 8 \\%$ nitric acid and $3 2 \\%$ water by mass, with a boiling point of 393.5 K. \n\nIntext Question \n\n1.8 The vapour pressure of pure liquids A and B are 450 and $7 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m \\ H g }$ respectively, at 350 K .

There are many properties of solutions which are connected with this decrease of vapour pressure. These are: (1) relative lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent (2) depression of freezing point of the solvent (3) elevation of boiling point of the solvent and (4) osmotic pressure of the solution. All these properties depend on the number of solute particles irrespective of their nature relative to the total number of particles present in the solution. Such properties are called colligative properties (colligative: from Latin: co means together, ligare means to bind). In the following Sections we will discuss these properties one by one. \n\n1.6.1 Relative Lowering of Vapour Pressure \n\nWe have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of a solvent in solution is less than that of the pure solvent. Raoult established that the lowering of vapour pressure depends only on the concentration of the solute particles and it is independent of their identity. The equation (1.20) given in Section 1.4.3 establishes a relation between vapour pressure of the solution, mole fraction and vapour pressure of the solvent, i.e., \n\nThe reduction in the vapour pressure of solvent $( \\Delta p _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } )$ is given as: \n\nKnowing that $x _ { 2 } = 1 - x _ { 1 }$ , equation (1.23) reduces to \n\nIn a solution containing several non-volatile solutes, the lowering of the vapour pressure depends on the sum of the mole fraction of different solutes. \n\nEquation (1.24) can be written as \n\nThe expression on the left hand side of the equation as mentioned earlier is called relative lowering of vapour pressure and is equal to the mole fraction of the solute.

The above equation can be written as: \n\nHere $n _ { 1 }$ and $n _ { 2 }$ are the number of moles of solvent and solute respectively present in the solution.

For example, the vapour pressure of an aqueous solution of sucrose is less than 1.013 bar at 373.15 K. In order to make this solution boil, its vapour pressure must be increased to 1.013 bar by raising the temperature above the boiling temperature of the pure solvent (water). Thus, the boiling point of a solution is always higher than that of the boiling point of the pure solvent in which the solution is prepared as shown in Fig. 1.7. Similar to lowering of vapour pressure, the elevation of boiling point also depends on the number of solute molecules rather than their nature. A solution of $1 \\ m 0 1$ of sucrose in $1 0 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of water boils at $3 7 3 . 5 2 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ at one atmospheric pressure. \n\nLet $T _ { \\mathrm { b } } ^ { 0 }$ be the boiling point of pure solvent and $T _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ be the boiling point of solution. The increase in the boiling point $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } } = T _ { \\mathrm { b } } - T _ { \\mathrm { b } } ^ { 0 }$ is known as elevation of boiling point. \n\nExperiments have shown that for dilute solutions the elevation of boiling point $( \\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } } )$ is directly proportional to the molal concentration of the solute in a solution. Thus \n\nHere $m$ (molality) is the number of moles of solute dissolved in $1 ~ \\mathrm { k g }$ of solvent and the constant of proportionality, $K _ { \\mathrm { { b } } }$ is called Boiling Point Elevation Constant or Molal Elevation Constant (Ebullioscopic Constant). The unit of $K _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ is $\\mathrm { K } \\mathrm { k g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ . Values of $K _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ for some common solvents are given in Table 1.3.

We know that at the freezing point of a substance, the solid phase is in dynamic equilibrium with the liquid phase. Thus, the freezing point of a substance may be defined as the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the substance in its liquid phase is equal to its vapour pressure in the solid phase. A solution will freeze when its vapour pressure equals the vapour pressure of the pure solid solvent as is clear from Fig. 1.8. According to Raoult's law, when a non-volatile solid is added to the solvent its vapour pressure decreases and now it would become equal to that of solid solvent at lower temperature. Thus, the freezing point of the solvent decreases. \n\nLet $T _ { \\mathrm { f } } ^ { 0 }$ be the freezing point",

These membranes can be of animal or vegetable origin and these occur naturally such as pig's bladder or parchment or can be synthetic such as cellophane. These membranes appear to be continuous sheets or films, yet they contain a network of submicroscopic holes or pores. Small solvent \n\nmolecules, like water, can pass through these holes but the passage of bigger molecules like solute is hindered. Membranes having this kind of properties are known as semipermeable membranes (SPM). \n\nAssume that only solvent molecules can pass through these semipermeable membranes. If this membrane is placed between the solvent and solution as shown in Fig. 1.9, the solvent molecules will flow through the membrane from pure solvent to the solution. This process of flow of the solvent is called osmosis. \n\nThe flow will continue till the equilibrium is attained. The flow of the solvent from its side to solution side across a semipermeable membrane can be stopped if some extra pressure is applied on the solution. This pressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called osmotic pressure of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to the concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to osmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules always flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution. The osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration of the solution. \n\nThe osmotic pressure of a solution is the excess pressure that must be applied to a solution to prevent osmosis, i.e., to stop the passage of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane into the solution. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.10. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property as it depends on the number of solute molecules and not on their identity. For dilute solutions, it has been found experimentally that osmotic pressure is proportional to the molarity, $\\pmb { c }$ of the solution at a given temperature $\\pmb { T }$ Thus: \n\nHere $\\Pi$ is the osmotic pressure and $\\mathrm { R }$ is the gas constant. \n\nHere $V$ is volume of a solution in litres containing $\\mathbf { n } _ { 2 }$ moles of solute. If $\\mathbf { w } _ { 2 }$ grams of solute, of molar mass, $M _ { 2 }$ is present in the solution, then $n _ { 2 } = \\mathrm { w } _ { 2 } \\ / \\ M _ { 2 }$ and we can write, \n\nThus, knowing the quantities $\\mathbf { w } _ { 2 }$ , $T , \\Pi$ and $V$ we can calculate the molar mass of the solute. \n\nMeasurement of osmotic pressure provides another method of determining molar masses of solutes. This method is widely used to determine molar masses of proteins, polymers and other macromolecules. The osmotic pressure method has the advantage over other methods as pressure measurement is around the room temperature and the molarity of the solution is used instead of molality. As compared to other colligative properties, its magnitude is large even for very dilute solutions. The technique of osmotic pressure for determination of molar mass of solutes is particularly useful for biomolecules as they are generally not stable at higher temperatures and polymers have poor solubility. \n\nTwo solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given temperature are called isotonic solutions. When such solutions are separated by semipermeable membrane no osmosis occurs between them. For example, the osmotic pressure associated with the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/volume) sodium chloride",

For example, the osmotic pressure associated with the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/volume) sodium chloride solution, called normal saline solution and it is safe to inject intravenously. On the other hand, if we place the cells in a solution containing more than $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/ volume) sodium chloride, water will flow out of the cells and they would shrink. Such a solution is called hypertonic. If the salt concentration is less than $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/volume), the solution is said to be hypotonic. In this case, water will flow into the cells if placed in this solution and they would swell. • \n\nExample 1.11 \n\n$2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m ^ { 3 } }$ of an aqueous solution of a protein contains $1 . 2 6 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of the protein.

A raw mango placed in concentrated salt solution loses water via osmosis and shrivel into pickle. Wilted flowers revive when placed in fresh water. A carrot that has become limp because of water loss into the atmosphere can be placed into the water making it firm once again. Water will move into its cells through osmosis. When placed in water containing less than $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/ volume) salt, blood cells swell due to flow of water in them by osmosis. People taking a lot of salt or salty food experience water retention in tissue cells and intercellular spaces because of osmosis. The resulting puffiness or swelling is called edema. Water movement from soil into plant roots and subsequently into upper portion of the plant is partly due to osmosis. The preservation of meat by salting and of fruits by adding sugar protects against bacterial action. Through the process of osmosis, a bacterium on salted meat or candid fruit loses water, shrivels and dies. \n\n1.6.5 Reverse Osmosis and water Purification \n\nThe direction of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure larger than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution side. That is, now the pure solvent flows out of the solution through the semi permeable membrane. This phenomenon is called reverse osmosis and is of great practical utility. Reverse osmosis is used in desalination of sea water. A schematic set up for the process is shown in Fig. 1.11. \n\nWhen pressure more than osmotic pressure is applied, pure water is squeezed out of the sea water through the membrane. A variety of polymer membranes are available for this purpose. \n\nThe pressure required for the reverse osmosis is quite high. A workable porous membrane is a film of cellulose acetate placed over a suitable support. Cellulose acetate is permeable to water but impermeable to impurities and ions present in sea water. These days many countries use desalination plants to meet their potable water requirements.",

A variety of polymer membranes are available for this purpose. \n\nThe pressure required for the reverse osmosis is quite high.

For example, if we dissolve one mole of KCl $( 7 4 . 5 \\mathrm { g } )$ in water, we expect one mole each of $\\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ and $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ ions to be released in the solution. If this happens, there would be two moles of particles in the solution.

This normally happens in solvents of low dielectric constant. In this case the number of particles is reduced due to dimerisation. Association of molecules is depicted as follows: \n\nIt can be undoubtedly stated here that if all the molecules of ethanoic acid associate in benzene, then $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ or $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ for ethanoic acid will be half of the normal value. The molar mass calculated on the basis of this $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ or $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ will, therefore, be twice the expected value. Such a molar mass that is either lower or higher than the expected or normal value is called as abnormal molar mass. \n\nIn l880 van't Hoff introduced a factor i, known as the van't Hoff factor, to account for the extent of dissociation or association. This factor i is defined as: - \n\nNormal molar mass Abnormal molar mass blis Observed colligative property Calculated colligative property i Total number of moles of particles after association/dissociation Number of moles of particles before association/dissociation \n\nHere abnormal molar mass is the experimentally determined molar mass and calculated colligative properties are obtained by assuming that the non-volatile solute is neither associated nor dissociated. In case of association, value of i is less than unity while for dissociation it is greater than unity. For example, the value of i for aqueous KCl solution is close to 2, while the value for ethanoic acid in benzene is nearly 0.5. \n\nInclusion of van't Hoff factor modifies the equations for colligative properties as follows: \n\nRelative lowering of vapour pressure of solvent, \n\nElevation of Boiling point, $\\Delta T _ { b } ^ { \\mathrm { ~ = ~ } i \\mathrm { ~ } K _ { b } }$ m Depression of Freezing point, $\\Delta T _ { f } = \\ i \\ K _ { f } \\ \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ Osmotic pressure of solution, $\\Pi \\ = \\ i \\ n _ { 2 } \\ R \\ T \\ / \\ V$ \n\nTable 1.4 depicts values of the factor, i for several strong electrolytes.

Solutions are classified as solid, liquid and gaseous solutions. The concentration of a solution is expressed in terms of mole fraction, molarity, molality and in percentages. The dissolution of a gas in a liquid is governed by Henry's law, according to which, at a given temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas. The vapour pressure of the solvent is lowered by the presence of a non-volatile solute in the solution and this lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent is governed by Raoult's law, according to which the relative lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent over a solution is equal to the mole fraction of a non-volatile solute present in the solution. However, in a binary liquid solution, if both the components of the solution are volatile then another form of Raoult's law is used. Mathematically, this form of the Raoult's law is stated as: $p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } } = p _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } ^ { \\mathrm { 0 } } x _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } + p _ { \\mathrm { 2 } } ^ { \\mathrm { 0 } } x _ { \\mathrm { 2 } }$ .

Solutions which obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration are called ideal solutions. Two types of deviations from Raoult's law, called positive and negative deviations are observed. Azeotropes arise due to very large deviations from Raoult's law. \n\nThe properties of solutions which depend on the number of solute particles and are independent of their chemical identity are called colligative properties. These are lowering of vapour pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point and osmotic pressure. The process of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure higher than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution. Colligative properties have been used to determine the molar mass of solutes. Solutes which dissociate in solution exhibit molar mass lower than the actual molar mass and those which associate show higher molar mass than their actual values. \n\nQuantitatively, the extent to which a solute is dissociated or associated can be expressed by van't Hoff factor i.

It categorizes solutions into three main types: Gaseous Solutions, Liquid Solutions, and Solid Solutions, each with subcategories based on the physical states of solute and solvent. For Gaseous Solutions, examples include mixtures like oxygen and nitrogen gases (gas in gas), chloroform mixed with nitrogen gas (liquid in gas), and camphor in nitrogen gas (solid in gas). Liquid Solutions include oxygen dissolved in water (gas in liquid) and ethanol or glucose dissolved in water (liquid or solid in liquid). Solid Solutions examples are hydrogen in palladium (gas in solid) and amalgams like mercury with sodium or copper dissolved in gold (solid in solid). The table illustrates the diversity of binary solutions by showing how solutes and solvents of different states combine, supporting the surrounding content's explanation of solution types and their formation. It emphasizes the concept that solutions are homogeneous mixtures with uniform properties, and the examples link directly to real-life applications such as gas mixtures in the atmosphere, aqueous solutions, and metal alloys. The table also implicitly supports the discussion on expressing concentration by showing the physical states involved, which influence how concentration units like mass percentage or mole fraction are applied. The presence of multiple states in solute and solvent combinations highlights the complexity and variety of solutions studied in the unit, reinforcing the foundational knowledge necessary for understanding solution properties and concentration expressions.",

Mathematically, molality is given by m = n_solute / m_solvent, where n_solute represents the amount of solute in moles, calculated by dividing the mass of the solute by its molar mass, and m_solvent is the mass of the solvent in kilograms. This ratio is a concentration measure independent of temperature and pressure since it relies on mass rather than volume. The equation involves fundamental operations of division and unit conversion (grams to kilograms). In the context of solution chemistry, molality is crucial for expressing solution concentration, especially when temperature variations affect volume but not mass. It complements other concentration measures such as molarity and mole fraction, providing a stable parameter for colligative property calculations and thermodynamic analyses. The equation's theoretical significance lies in its role in quantifying solute concentration relative to solvent mass, facilitating precise stoichiometric and physical property predictions in chemical solutions. Practically, it is used in preparing solutions with specific properties, studying freezing point depression, boiling point elevation, and vapor pressure lowering. Within the broader framework of solution concentration expressions, this equation highlights the importance of mass-based concentration metrics in chemical and physical chemistry.",

It is divided into two main parts labeled (a) and (b), illustrating the effect of pressure on gas solubility in a liquid. Part (a) shows a container with two distinct regions: the lower region contains a liquid solution, and the upper region contains a gas phase at pressure p and temperature T. The gas phase is depicted with scattered gas molecules above the liquid surface, indicating a state of dynamic equilibrium where the rate of gas molecules entering and leaving the solution is balanced. Part (b) shows the same container but with the gas phase compressed to a smaller volume, increasing the gas pressure above the solution. This is visually represented by a higher density of gas molecules in the upper region, indicating increased pressure. The diagram uses arrows to show the movement of gas molecules between the gas phase and the liquid solution, emphasizing the dynamic exchange process. The color scheme is simple and functional, using blue to represent the liquid solution and gray or white for the gas molecules and container. The lighting is flat and schematic, typical of educational scientific illustrations. The visual style is clean and minimalistic, focusing on clarity and conceptual explanation rather than artistic detail. This diagram directly relates to the surrounding text discussing Henry's law and the relationship between gas pressure and solubility, visually reinforcing the concept that increasing gas pressure increases gas solubility in a liquid until a new equilibrium is established.",

The graph is plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system with the x-axis labeled as the mole fraction of HCl gas in the solution and the y-axis labeled as the partial pressure of HCl gas in bar. The x-axis values range from 0 to approximately 0.0006, indicating very low mole fractions, while the y-axis values range from 0 to 0.06 bar. A series of discrete data points are plotted on the graph, each represented by small black dots. These points form a linear trend ascending from the origin towards the upper right corner of the graph, demonstrating a direct proportionality between the mole fraction and the partial pressure. A straight line is drawn through the data points, representing the best fit or trend line, which confirms Henry's law that the partial pressure of a gas above a solution is proportional to its mole fraction in the solution. The slope of this line corresponds to the Henry's law constant (K_H) for HCl gas in cyclohexane at 293 K. The graph is cleanly designed with clear axis labels and a title at the top reading \"Fig. 1.2: Experimental results for the solubility of HCl gas in cyclohexane at 293 K.\" The background is white, and the graph lines and text are in black, providing high contrast and readability. The visual style is scientific and formal, typical of textbook or academic publication figures. This graph visually supports the surrounding text's explanation of Henry's law and the relationship between gas solubility and partial pressure, providing empirical evidence for the proportionality constant and reinforcing the concept that solubility depends on the nature of the gas and solvent as well as temperature.",

Here, p denotes the partial pressure of the gas in the vapor phase, x is the mole fraction of the gas dissolved in the solvent, and K_H is Henry's law constant, a proportionality factor dependent on the nature of the gas and temperature. Mathematically, this is a linear relationship indicating direct proportionality between gas solubility and its partial pressure. The equation involves simple multiplication, reflecting a first-order dependence without higher-order or nonlinear terms. In the context of gas solubility in liquids, this law is fundamental for understanding how gases dissolve under varying pressures, especially in aqueous solutions. Physically, it embodies the dynamic equilibrium between gas molecules entering and leaving the solution, governed by molecular interactions and thermodynamic principles. The constant K_H encapsulates the affinity of the gas for the solvent and varies with temperature, typically increasing with temperature, which corresponds to decreased solubility. This equation is closely related to concepts of dynamic equilibrium, partial pressure, mole fraction, and thermodynamic solubility. Practically, it is applied in environmental science (e.g., oxygen solubility in water sustaining aquatic life), industrial processes (carbonation of beverages), and physiological contexts (scuba diving gas absorption). Within the broader framework of solubility phenomena, this equation complements the discussion on how temperature and pressure influence solubility, specifically highlighting the distinct behavior of gases compared to solids in liquids.",

The left side lists gases such as Helium (He), Hydrogen (H_2), Nitrogen (N_2), and Oxygen (O_2) at temperatures 293 K and 303 K, while the right side lists Argon, Carbon Dioxide (CO_2), Formaldehyde, Methane, and Vinyl chloride at 298 K or 298-299 K. The Henry's law constant (K_H) quantifies the proportionality between the partial pressure of a gas and its mole fraction in solution, with higher K_H values indicating lower solubility.\n\nKey data points include: Helium has a high K_H of 144.97 kbar at 293 K, indicating low solubility; Nitrogen's K_H increases from 76.48 kbar at 293 K to 88.84 kbar at 303 K, showing decreased solubility with temperature rise; Oxygen's K_H increases from 34.86 kbar at 293 K to 46.82 kbar at 303 K, consistent with the temperature effect; CO_2 has a very low K_H of 1.67 kbar at 298 K, indicating high solubility; Formaldehyde and Methane have extremely low K_H values (1.83×10^-5 and 0.413-0.611 kbar respectively), suggesting very high solubility.\n\nStatistical trends reveal that for diatomic gases like N_2 and O_2, K_H increases with temperature, confirming the inverse relationship between solubility and temperature. The variation in K_H among gases at similar temperatures reflects the influence of gas nature on solubility, supporting the text's assertion that K_H depends on gas identity. The table's data directly supports the surrounding content's explanation of Henry's law, illustrating how different gases dissolve in water under varying temperatures and pressures.\n\nThe relationship between temperature and K_H values in the table exemplifies the exothermic nature of gas dissolution, as higher temperatures reduce solubility (higher K_H). This explains biological phenomena such as aquatic species' preference for cold water and the medical implications for scuba divers due to gas solubility changes with pressure and temperature. The table also underpins industrial applications like carbonation of soft drinks and the use of helium in diving tanks to mitigate nitrogen toxicity.\n\nOverall, the table concretely illustrates Henry's law constants for various gases, reinforcing the theoretical concepts and practical examples discussed in the surrounding text about gas solubility, temperature effects, and pressure relationships in aqueous solutions.",

It states that the mole fraction x of nitrogen gas in the aqueous solution is equal to the ratio of the partial pressure p of nitrogen gas above the solution to Henry's law constant K_H for nitrogen at the given temperature. Here, x is the mole fraction of nitrogen in the liquid phase (dimensionless), p is the partial pressure of nitrogen gas in bar, and K_H is Henry's law constant in bar, characterizing the solubility of nitrogen in water at 293 K. The equation uses a simple division operation to relate gas phase pressure to solubility in the liquid phase, reflecting a direct proportionality between solubility and partial pressure. This formulation is fundamental in physical chemistry and chemical engineering for quantifying gas solubility in liquids under equilibrium conditions. The constant K_H depends on temperature and the nature of the gas, indicating that solubility decreases with increasing temperature for nitrogen. The equation is applied in contexts such as calculating dissolved gas amounts in water, understanding aquatic life conditions, and industrial processes involving gas-liquid equilibria. It connects to broader concepts of gas solubility, partial pressures, and equilibrium thermodynamics, and serves as a basis for practical applications like carbonation of beverages, scuba diving safety, and environmental science. The numerical example demonstrates how to compute the mole fraction from known pressure and Henry's constant, illustrating the quantitative use of Henry's law in real-world scenarios.",

The graph features three distinct lines plotted on a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. The x-axis represents the mole fraction of component 2 (x2), ranging from 0 to 1, while the y-axis represents vapour pressure, presumably in mm Hg or a similar unit, with values increasing upwards. The graph includes two dashed lines labeled I and II, which represent the partial vapour pressures of the two components in the binary solution. Line I starts at a higher vapour pressure value on the y-axis when x2 is 0 and decreases linearly to zero as x2 approaches 1, indicating the partial pressure of component 1 (p1) is proportional to its mole fraction (x1 = 1 - x2). Line II starts at zero vapour pressure when x2 is 0 and increases linearly to a higher vapour pressure value as x2 reaches 1, representing the partial pressure of component 2 (p2) proportional to its mole fraction (x2). A third solid line, labeled III, lies between the two dashed lines and represents the total vapour pressure (p_total) of the solution, which varies linearly with the mole fraction of component 2. The total vapour pressure line starts at the vapour pressure of pure component 1 (p1^0) when x2 is 0 and ends at the vapour pressure of pure component 2 (p2^0) when x2 is 1. The graph visually demonstrates Raoult's law, showing that the partial vapour pressures of each component are directly proportional to their mole fractions in the solution, and the total vapour pressure is the sum of these partial pressures.

Here, p_i denotes the partial pressure of component i, y_i is the mole fraction of component i in the vapor phase, and p_total is the total vapor pressure above the solution. Mathematically, this is a direct application of Dalton's law of partial pressures, which states that the total pressure exerted by a gaseous mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of each individual component. The mole fraction y_i serves as a weighting factor indicating the proportion of component i in the vapor phase. This linear relationship implies that the partial pressure of each component is proportional to its mole fraction in the vapor. The equation is fundamental in thermodynamics and physical chemistry for describing phase equilibria, particularly vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE). It connects the composition of the vapor phase to measurable pressures, enabling the determination of vapor phase composition from total pressure and vice versa. This equation complements Raoult's law, which relates the partial pressure of a component to its mole fraction in the liquid phase and the pure component vapor pressure. Together, these laws allow calculation of vapor pressures and compositions in binary or multicomponent solutions, as illustrated in the surrounding context with chloroform and dichloromethane mixtures. The physical significance lies in predicting how volatile components distribute between liquid and vapor phases, critical for distillation, solvent recovery, and chemical process design. The equation also underpins the understanding that the vapor phase is richer in the more volatile component, as the mole fraction y_i in vapor reflects volatility differences. Overall, this equation is a cornerstone in the quantitative description of vapor-liquid equilibria and is essential for practical applications in chemical engineering, environmental science, and materials processing.",

Mathematically, it expresses p_total as a linear interpolation between the vapor pressures of the pure components, p_1^0 and p_2^0, weighted by the mole fraction x_2. Here, p_1^0 and p_2^0 denote the vapor pressures of pure components 1 and 2 respectively at a given temperature, and x_2 is the mole fraction of component 2 in the liquid phase. The equation uses basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, and multiplication, reflecting the linear dependence of total vapor pressure on composition. This formulation is grounded in Dalton's law of partial pressures and Raoult's law, which states that the partial vapor pressure of each component in an ideal solution is proportional to its mole fraction times its pure component vapor pressure. The physical significance lies in predicting how the total vapor pressure changes with solution composition, crucial for understanding phase equilibria in binary mixtures.

The layout is horizontal with two side-by-side panels labeled (a) and (b). Panel (a) depicts a pure solvent surface where only solvent molecules are present. These solvent molecules are represented as small solid circles densely packed at the surface, with some molecules shown escaping upwards, indicated by open circles (O) above the surface, symbolizing evaporation. The background is plain, emphasizing the molecular arrangement at the surface. Panel (b) shows a solution where solute particles, represented by larger open circles with a smaller circle inside (\\textcircled{\\circ}), occupy part of the surface area alongside the solvent molecules (solid circles). The surface is thus partially covered by solute particles, reducing the area available for solvent molecules. Correspondingly, fewer solvent molecules are shown escaping from the surface compared to panel (a), visually conveying the reduction in vapour pressure. The color scheme is simple, using black and white with clear symbolic shapes to differentiate solvent and solute particles. The lighting is uniform with no shading, consistent with a schematic style. The image directly relates to the surrounding text explaining how the addition of a non-volatile solute reduces the vapour pressure of the solvent by decreasing the surface area available for solvent evaporation. This visual aid supports the conceptual explanation of Raoult's law and the physical basis for vapour pressure lowering in solutions. The technical style is typical of educational chemistry diagrams, focusing on clarity and conceptual illustration rather than realistic depiction.",

Specifically, p_1 = x_1 p_1^0, where p_1^0 is the vapor pressure of the pure solvent. Here, p_1 represents the partial vapor pressure exerted by the solvent molecules in the vapor phase at equilibrium, x_1 is the mole fraction of the solvent in the liquid phase, and p_1^0 is a constant characteristic of the pure solvent at the given temperature. The proportionality reflects the linear dependence of vapor pressure on solvent concentration in ideal solutions, where intermolecular interactions between solvent and solute molecules are similar to those in the pure components. The equation involves basic algebraic operations and proportionality concepts. It is fundamental in physical chemistry and thermodynamics for describing ideal solution behavior, vapor-liquid equilibrium, and colligative properties. The equation serves as a special case of Henry's law when the proportionality constant equals the pure solvent vapor pressure. It underpins the classification of solutions into ideal and non-ideal, and deviations from this law indicate molecular interaction differences leading to positive or negative deviations. Practically, it is used to predict vapor pressures in mixtures, design separation processes like distillation, and understand solution properties in chemical engineering and materials science. Within the broader framework, this equation provides a baseline for analyzing solution behavior, interpreting deviations, and connecting molecular interactions to macroscopic thermodynamic properties.",

The equation is a defining characteristic of ideal solutions, which also exhibit zero volume change upon mixing. This condition implies that the solution behaves as a perfect thermodynamic mixture without excess enthalpy, aligning with Raoult's law where the partial vapor pressures are linearly proportional to mole fractions.

Both graphs share a similar layout with the x-axis representing the mole fraction of component A (ranging from 0 to 1) and the y-axis representing vapour pressure in mm Hg. In Fig. 1.6 (a), the graph depicts a solution exhibiting positive deviation from Raoult's law. The vapour pressure curve is convex, rising above the ideal linear line that connects the vapour pressures of pure components A and B at mole fractions 0 and 1 respectively. This indicates that the vapour pressure of the mixture is higher than predicted by Raoult's law, consistent with weaker A-B intermolecular interactions compared to A-A and B-B interactions. The curve starts at the vapour pressure of pure component B on the left (mole fraction A = 0) and ends at the vapour pressure of pure component A on the right (mole fraction A = 1). In Fig. 1.6 (b), the graph shows a solution with negative deviation from Raoult's law. The vapour pressure curve is concave, lying below the ideal linear line between the pure components' vapour pressures. This indicates stronger A-B interactions than A-A and B-B, resulting in a lower vapour pressure than predicted. Both graphs use solid lines for the actual vapour pressure curves and dashed lines for the ideal linear Raoult's law predictions. The colors used are primarily black for lines and axes, with clear labeling of axes and data points. The visual style is typical of scientific textbook figures, with clean, precise lines and clear typography. The image directly relates to the surrounding text on page 12, which discusses ideal and non-ideal solutions, Raoult's law, and deviations caused by molecular interactions.

Here, p_1 is the partial vapor pressure of component 1 in the mixture, x_1 is the mole fraction of component 1 in the liquid phase, and p_1^0 is the vapor pressure of pure component 1. The equation involves multiplication of a mole fraction (a dimensionless quantity between 0 and 1) by a vapor pressure (typically measured in mm Hg or bar), yielding the partial vapor pressure of the component in the solution. This linear relationship assumes ideal behavior with no intermolecular interactions deviating from ideality. The context discusses deviations from Raoult's law, azeotropes, and colligative properties, highlighting the importance of this equation in understanding vapor-liquid equilibria, solution behavior, and phase separation. Physically, it quantifies how the presence of other components reduces the escaping tendency of molecules, thus lowering vapor pressure. The equation is foundational in thermodynamics and physical chemistry for predicting vapor pressures of mixtures, calculating compositions of vapor and liquid phases, and analyzing colligative properties such as vapor pressure lowering, boiling point elevation, and freezing point depression. It relates to other concepts like deviations from ideality (positive and negative deviations), azeotrope formation, and the calculation of molar masses from vapor pressure data. Practically, it is used in distillation, solvent selection, chemical engineering design, and understanding solution properties. Within the broader framework, this equation serves as the baseline model from which deviations and complex solution behaviors are analyzed, providing a quantitative tool to connect molecular composition with macroscopic vapor pressure phenomena.",

It depicts two vapor pressure curves plotted against temperature in Kelvin (K). The x-axis represents temperature ranging approximately from 360 K to 380 K, and the y-axis represents vapor pressure in bar, ranging from 0.8 to 1.05 bar. Two distinct curves are shown: one labeled 'Pure water' and the other labeled 'Solution.' The curve for pure water lies above the curve for the solution across the temperature range, indicating that the vapor pressure of the solution is consistently lower than that of pure water at the same temperature. A horizontal dashed line is drawn at 1.013 bar, representing atmospheric pressure. The boiling point of pure water, denoted as T_b^0, is marked where the pure water curve intersects the atmospheric pressure line, approximately at 373.15 K (100°C). The boiling point of the solution, denoted as T_b, is marked where the solution curve intersects the atmospheric pressure line, at a higher temperature than T_b^0. The difference between these two boiling points, ΔT_b = T_b - T_b^0, is indicated on the graph, illustrating the elevation of boiling point due to the presence of solute. The graph uses a clean, scientific style with clear labels and a legend. The color scheme uses blue for the pure water curve and red for the solution curve, enhancing visual distinction. The image visually supports the surrounding text's explanation of boiling point elevation, showing how the vapor pressure of a solution is lower than that of the pure solvent, requiring a higher temperature to reach atmospheric pressure and boil.",

The proportionality constant \\( K_{\\mathrm{b}} \\), known as the ebullioscopic constant or molal boiling point elevation constant, depends on the solvent's intrinsic properties and has units of Kelvin kilogram per mole (K kg mol\\(^{-1}\\)). The molality \\( m \\) is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent, \\( m = \\frac{n_2}{w_1/1000} \\), where \\( n_2 \\) is moles of solute and \\( w_1 \\) is mass of solvent in grams. This linear relationship holds accurately for dilute solutions where solute-solute interactions are negligible. The equation is derived from colligative properties principles, emphasizing that boiling point elevation depends on solute particle quantity rather than chemical identity. It is fundamental in physical chemistry for determining molar masses of unknown solutes by measuring boiling point changes experimentally. The equation connects thermodynamic concepts of vapor pressure lowering and phase equilibrium, as the boiling point elevation arises due to decreased solvent vapor pressure in the presence of solute, requiring higher temperature to reach atmospheric pressure. Practical applications include molecular weight determination, purity analysis, and formulation of solutions in chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Within the broader framework, this equation complements related colligative property equations such as vapor pressure lowering and freezing point depression, providing a comprehensive understanding of solution behavior and solvent-solute interactions in dilute regimes.",

Mathematically, it states that the freezing point depression \\( \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{f}} \\) is directly proportional to the molality \\( m \\) of the solute in the solution. Here, \\( \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{f}} = T_{\\mathrm{f}}^{0} - T_{\\mathrm{f}} \\) represents the decrease in freezing point, where \\( T_{\\mathrm{f}}^{0} \\) is the freezing point of the pure solvent and \\( T_{\\mathrm{f}} \\) is the freezing point of the solution. The proportionality constant \\( K_{\\mathrm{f}} \\), known as the freezing point depression constant or cryoscopic constant, depends on the solvent's intrinsic properties and has units of kelvin kilogram per mole (K kg mol^{-1}). The molality \\( m \\) is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent, \\( m = \\frac{n_{solute}}{mass_{solvent}} \\). This linear relationship arises from colligative properties, which depend solely on solute particle concentration, not their identity. The equation is derived under the assumption of ideal dilute solutions where solute-solvent interactions do not significantly deviate from ideality. Physically, the freezing point depression occurs because the solute lowers the solvent's vapor pressure, shifting the equilibrium between solid and liquid phases to a lower temperature. This equation is fundamental in physical chemistry and thermodynamics, linking phase equilibria with solution concentration. It is closely related to the boiling point elevation equation \\( \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{b}} = K_{\\mathrm{b}} m \\), where \\( K_{\\mathrm{b}} \\) is the ebullioscopic constant. Practically, this relation is used to determine molar masses of unknown solutes by measuring freezing point depression, and in applications such as antifreeze formulations and cryoscopy. Within the broader framework, it exemplifies how colligative properties provide insight into molecular characteristics and solution behavior, reinforcing the connection between macroscopic thermodynamic measurements and microscopic molecular quantities.",

Mathematically, both constants are expressed as functions of fundamental thermodynamic and physical properties of the solvent: the universal gas constant (R), the molar mass of the solvent (M_l), the square of the pure solvent's phase transition temperature (T_f for freezing, T_b for boiling), and the enthalpy changes associated with the phase transitions (Δ_fusH for fusion and Δ_vapH for vaporization). The division by 1000 is a unit conversion factor to maintain consistency in units. These constants quantify how much the freezing point lowers or the boiling point raises per molal concentration of a solute in an ideal dilute solution. The equations arise from thermodynamic principles relating vapor pressure changes and phase equilibria to colligative properties. They connect macroscopic measurable quantities (K_f, K_b) to molecular-level thermodynamic parameters, enabling calculation of colligative effects without direct experimental determination of K_f or K_b. This is crucial in physical chemistry and solution thermodynamics for determining molar masses of solutes, understanding solvent-solute interactions, and designing processes involving phase changes. The equations relate to Raoult's law and the concept of chemical potential equilibrium at phase boundaries, integrating thermodynamics with practical colligative property measurements. They provide a theoretical framework underpinning the empirical constants used in boiling point elevation and freezing point depression calculations, as illustrated in the surrounding examples involving benzene, water, and ethylene glycol solutions.",

The first column lists nine solvents by name. The second column provides the boiling point in Kelvin and the molal boiling point elevation constant (Kb) in K kg mol-1, indicating how much the boiling point of the solvent increases per molal concentration of a solute. The third column shows the freezing point in Kelvin, and the fourth column lists the molal freezing point depression constant (Kf) in K kg mol-1, representing the decrease in freezing point per molal concentration of solute. Key data points include water with a boiling point of 373.15 K, Kb of 0.52, freezing point 273.0 K, and Kf of 1.86; benzene with boiling point 353.3 K, Kb 2.53, freezing point 278.6 K, and Kf 5.12; and carbon tetrachloride with boiling point 350.0 K, Kb 5.03, freezing point 250.5 K, and Kf 31.8. Patterns show that solvents with higher Kb values tend to have higher boiling point elevation effects, and those with higher Kf values exhibit greater freezing point depression effects. For example, carbon tetrachloride has the highest Kb (5.03) and Kf (31.8), indicating strong colligative property effects. The relationship between boiling point elevation and freezing point depression constants reflects the solvent's molecular interactions and thermodynamic properties. This table supports the surrounding content by providing empirical constants (Kb and Kf) necessary for calculating boiling point elevation and freezing point depression in solutions, as demonstrated in the examples on pages 17 and 19.

It relates the freezing point depression constant (K_f), the mass of the solute (w_2), the mass of the solvent (w_1), and the observed freezing point depression (ΔT_f). Specifically, the formula rearranges the freezing point depression relation ΔT_f = K_f * m (where m is molality) to solve for molar mass: M_2 = (K_f * w_2 * 1000) / (ΔT_f * w_1). Variables are defined as follows: K_f (cryoscopic constant) in K kg mol^-1, w_2 (solute mass in grams), w_1 (solvent mass in grams), and ΔT_f (freezing point depression in Kelvin). The multiplication by 1000 converts solvent mass from grams to kilograms to maintain unit consistency in molality. The equation uses division and multiplication operations and is grounded in thermodynamics and physical chemistry principles. It is applied in determining molar masses of solutes, especially non-electrolytes, by measuring freezing point depression. This method is significant for characterizing molecular weights of substances that do not ionize in solution. The equation connects to other colligative property equations and complements osmotic pressure and boiling point elevation methods discussed in the context. Practically, it is used in chemical analysis, quality control, and research to identify unknown solutes or verify purity. Within the broader framework, it exemplifies how colligative properties provide indirect but reliable means to ascertain molecular characteristics through macroscopic measurements.",

The thistle funnel is filled with a solution and is inserted into a container holding pure solvent. The funnel is sealed with a semipermeable membrane at its narrow end, which is submerged in the solvent. The solvent level inside the thistle funnel is shown to rise compared to the solvent level outside in the container, visually demonstrating the osmotic flow of solvent molecules through the semipermeable membrane into the solution. The setup includes a vertical scale or markings on the thistle funnel to indicate the rising liquid level. The background is plain, focusing attention on the apparatus. The colors are realistic with the glass apparatus rendered in transparent or light blue tones, the solution inside the funnel depicted in a slightly darker shade to differentiate it from the pure solvent. The lighting is even and neutral, emphasizing clarity and scientific accuracy. The image is a technical diagram rather than a photograph, with clean lines and labels, designed to visually support the explanation of osmosis in the surrounding text. The caption 'Fig. 1.9 Level of solution rises in the thistle funnel due to osmosis of solvent.' directly relates the visual to the concept of solvent movement through a semipermeable membrane, reinforcing the textual description of osmotic pressure and solvent flow from pure solvent to solution.

The composition is a schematic diagram showing two compartments separated by a vertical semipermeable membrane. The left compartment contains pure solvent, depicted as a clear liquid, while the right compartment contains a solution with solute particles dispersed in the solvent. The solute particles are represented as small colored spheres or dots suspended in the solution. Above the solution side, an arrow points downward indicating an applied pressure labeled as 'Excess Pressure = Osmotic Pressure'. This pressure is shown acting on the solution side to prevent the flow of solvent molecules from the pure solvent side to the solution side. The membrane is visually represented as a thin vertical barrier with small pores, emphasizing its selective permeability that allows only solvent molecules to pass through but blocks solute particles. The background is plain, focusing attention on the diagram elements. The colors used are simple and clear: the solvent is typically shown in a light blue or transparent shade, solute particles in a contrasting color such as red or orange, and the membrane in gray or black. The lighting is uniform with no shadows, consistent with a technical illustration style. The diagram effectively conveys the principle that osmotic pressure is the excess pressure required to stop osmosis, aligning with the surrounding text on page 19 that explains osmotic pressure as a colligative property dependent on solute concentration. This image supports the theoretical explanation by providing a clear visual representation of the physical setup and forces involved in osmosis and osmotic pressure measurement.",

The formula rearranges the osmotic pressure relation \\( \\Pi = \\frac{n_2}{V}RT \\), where \\( n_2 = \\frac{w_2}{M_2} \\) is the number of moles of solute, \\( w_2 \\) is the mass of solute, \\( V \\) is the solution volume, \\( R \\) is the universal gas constant, and \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature. By substituting \\( n_2 \\) and solving for \\( M_2 \\), the equation expresses molar mass as \\( M_2 = \\frac{w_2 R T}{\\Pi V} \\). Variables are defined as: \\( w_2 = 1.26 \\) g (solute mass), \\( R = 0.083 \\) L·bar·K^{-1}·mol^{-1} (gas constant), \\( T = 300 \\) K (temperature), \\( \\Pi = 2.57 \\times 10^{-3} \\) bar (osmotic pressure), and \\( V = 0.200 \\) L (solution volume). The mathematical operations include multiplication, division, and substitution into a derived formula from the ideal gas law analogy for osmotic pressure. This equation is significant in physical chemistry and biochemistry for determining molar masses of macromolecules like proteins and polymers, especially when other methods are impractical. It relates osmotic pressure, a thermodynamic colligative property, to molecular characteristics, enabling practical applications such as protein characterization and polymer analysis. Within the broader context, it exemplifies how osmotic pressure measurements provide a reliable, room-temperature method for molar mass determination, highlighting the interplay between solution properties and molecular parameters in semipermeable membrane systems.",

The layout is horizontally oriented, showing two compartments separated by a semipermeable membrane. On the left side, labeled 'Sea Water' or 'Solution Side,' there is a depiction of seawater containing dissolved salts and impurities, represented by small colored dots or particles. On the right side, labeled 'Pure Water' or 'Solvent Side,' there is clear water with no impurities. Above the solution side, a mechanical press or piston is shown applying pressure, indicated by an arrow pointing downward, symbolizing the external pressure greater than the osmotic pressure. The semipermeable membrane is depicted as a thin vertical barrier that allows only water molecules to pass through while blocking salts and impurities. Arrows show the direction of water flow from the seawater side through the membrane to the pure water side, opposite to natural osmosis. The colors used are primarily blue tones for water, with darker shades representing seawater and lighter shades for pure water. The membrane is shown in a neutral color, such as gray or white, to distinguish it from the fluids. The diagram includes labels and possibly a legend to clarify components like 'Pressure > Osmotic Pressure,' 'Semipermeable Membrane,' 'Sea Water,' and 'Pure Water.' The visual style is clean and schematic, typical of educational scientific illustrations, focusing on clarity and conceptual understanding rather than photorealism. This image directly relates to the surrounding content explaining reverse osmosis, its mechanism, and its application in desalination, reinforcing the textual explanation with a visual aid that highlights the reversal of natural osmotic flow by applying external pressure.",

Mathematically, it expresses the fractional decrease in vapor pressure (p_1^∘ - p_1) / p_1^∘ of the pure solvent (p_1^∘) upon addition of a solute, where p_1 is the vapor pressure of the solvent in solution. The variables n_2 and n_1 denote the number of moles of solute and solvent, respectively. The van't Hoff factor i quantifies the effective number of solute particles in solution after dissociation or association, modifying the ideal colligative property predictions. The equation is derived from Raoult's law and colligative property theory, extended to real solutions where solute particles may not remain intact. It is fundamental in physical chemistry for understanding how solutes affect solvent properties, especially in electrolyte solutions and molecular associations. This relation is crucial for calculating osmotic pressure, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, and vapor pressure lowering, all of which depend on the number of solute particles rather than their chemical identity. The equation links to the broader discussion on abnormal molar masses and the van't Hoff factor, providing a quantitative framework to interpret deviations from ideal solution behavior due to ionic dissociation or molecular association. Practical applications include water purification, desalination, and determining molecular weights of solutes via colligative properties in chemical and biochemical contexts.",

The van't Hoff factor i quantifies the extent of dissociation of electrolytes in solution, with values approaching the theoretical maximum for complete dissociation as concentration decreases. The table is organized with salts listed in the first column, followed by three columns showing observed i values at decreasing concentrations, and a final column showing the theoretical i for complete dissociation. For NaCl and KCl, i values increase from approximately 1.85-1.87 at 0.1 m to 1.97-1.98 at 0.001 m, approaching the theoretical value of 2.00, indicating near-complete dissociation at low concentrations. For MgSO4, i values rise from 1.21 at 0.1 m to 1.82 at 0.001 m, approaching but not reaching the theoretical 2.00, suggesting partial dissociation. For K2SO4, i values increase from 2.32 at 0.1 m to 2.84 at 0.001 m, nearing the theoretical 3.00, consistent with its three ions per formula unit. The footnote clarifies that the tabulated i values represent incomplete dissociation. The data illustrate the concentration dependence of electrolyte dissociation, supporting the surrounding discussion on van't Hoff factor as a measure of association/dissociation in solutions. The table concretely demonstrates how i approaches theoretical values at infinite dilution, validating the concept that colligative properties must be corrected by i to account for ionization extent. This supports the examples and equations in the text explaining abnormal molar masses and colligative property deviations due to association or dissociation, such as the nearly 0.5 i for ethanoic acid dimers and ~2 for KCl. Overall, the table provides empirical evidence for the theoretical framework of van't Hoff factor and its role in interpreting colligative phenomena in electrolyte solutions.",

Mathematically, it is given by i = (n(1 + x)) / n = 1 + x, where n represents the initial number of moles of the solute before dissociation, and x is the fraction of solute molecules that dissociate into ions. The numerator n(1 + x) accounts for the total number of particles after dissociation: n(1 - x) moles remain undissociated, and n x moles dissociate into ions, effectively increasing the total particle count. The division by n normalizes this to a per mole basis. The equation uses basic algebraic operations and the concept of mole fractions to relate dissociation to colligative properties. In the context of the surrounding material, this equation is applied to weak electrolytes like acetic acid, where partial dissociation affects colligative properties such as freezing point depression. The van't Hoff factor quantifies the effect of dissociation on these properties, linking physical chemistry concepts of solution behavior, electrolyte dissociation equilibria, and colligative phenomena. The equation is fundamental in determining the degree of dissociation from experimental measurements of colligative properties, thereby connecting theoretical dissociation constants with practical observations. It also relates to other concepts such as molar mass determination and electrolyte strength discussed in the context. Practically, this equation is used in analytical chemistry to evaluate the extent of ionization of weak acids or bases in solution, which is critical for understanding solution conductivity, reaction equilibria, and formulation of chemical products. Overall, it integrates the microscopic dissociation process with macroscopic measurable properties, providing a quantitative framework within the broader discussion of solution chemistry and colligative effects.",

Mathematically, K_a is defined as the ratio of the product of the molar concentrations of the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and hydrogen ion (H^+) to the molar concentration of undissociated acetic acid (CH3COOH). Here, the variables [CH3COO^-], [H^+], and [CH3COOH] denote the equilibrium molar concentrations of the respective species. The equation uses multiplication and division operations to express this ratio. The numerical values substituted correspond to the molality of acetic acid (0.0106 mol/kg) and the degree of dissociation (x = 0.041), reflecting the fraction of acid molecules dissociated into ions. The denominator accounts for the remaining undissociated acid concentration, calculated as the initial molality times (1 - x). This expression arises from the equilibrium condition of a weak acid dissociation reaction, linking the experimentally determined van't Hoff factor and freezing point depression to the acid's dissociation constant. The equation is central in physical chemistry and solution chemistry, providing insight into acid strength, ionization equilibria, and colligative properties.

The first row lists mole fractions of acetone ranging from 0 to 72.1%, indicating the composition of the binary mixture. The second row shows the vapor pressure of acetone (Pacetone) in mm Hg, increasing from 0 mm Hg at 0% acetone to 521.1 mm Hg at 72.1% acetone, reflecting the rising partial pressure of acetone as its mole fraction increases. The third row provides the vapor pressure of chloroform (Pchloroform) in mm Hg, decreasing from 632.8 mm Hg at 0% acetone (pure chloroform) to 120.7 mm Hg at 72.1% acetone, showing the reduction in chloroform partial pressure as acetone concentration rises. The data illustrate the vapor-liquid equilibrium behavior of the acetone-chloroform system, supporting the surrounding content's discussion on ideal and non-ideal solutions and deviations from Raoult's law. The trends indicate a negative deviation from ideality, as the total vapor pressure (sum of partial pressures) is lower than expected for an ideal solution, consistent with strong intermolecular interactions between acetone and chloroform molecules. This table concretely supports the concept of solution behavior and vapor pressure changes with composition, as discussed in the exercises on page 28, particularly problem 1.37.",

The subject is of importance both for theoretical and practical considerations. A large number of metals, sodium hydroxide, chlorine, fluorine and many other chemicals are produced by electrochemical methods. Batteries and fuel cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy and are used on a large scale in various instruments and devices. The reactions carried out electrochemically can be energy efficient and less polluting. Therefore, study of electrochemistry is important for creating new technologies that are ecofriendly. The transmission of sensory signals through cells to brain and vice versa and communication between the cells are known to have electrochemical origin. Electrochemistry, is therefore, a very vast and interdisciplinary subject. In this Unit, we will cover only some of its important elementary aspects. \n\nWe had studied the construction and functioning of Daniell cell (Fig. 2.1).

In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for running a motor or other electrical gadgets like heater, fan, geyser, etc. \n\nDaniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following redox reaction occurs. \n\nThis reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition gives the overall cell reaction: \n\nThese reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell. The reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the oxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions of the cell are also called half-cells or redox couples. The copper electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode, the oxidation half-cell. \n\nWe can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each halfcell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two half-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1. Sometimes, both the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we do not require a salt bridge. \n\nAt each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make it positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode have a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the electrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At equilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively or negatively charged with respect to the solution. A potential difference develops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called electrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved in a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard electrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other half-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a positive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a potential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the switch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of electron flow. \n\nThe potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic cell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell potential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive force (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and the cathode on the right while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal and electrolyte solution and",

It is called the cell electromotive force (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and the cathode on the right while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal and electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the halfcell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the left hand side i.e., \n\nThis is illustrated by the following example: \n\nCell reaction: \n\nHalf-cell reactions: \n\nIt can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction (2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as: \n\nThe potential of individual half-cell cannot be measured. We can measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one electrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect to this. According to convention, a half-cell called standard hydrogen electrode (Fig.3.3) represented by $\\mathrm { P t ( \\bar { s } ) } \\mid \\mathrm { H _ { 2 } ( g ) } \\mid \\mathrm { H ^ { + } ( a q ) }$ , is assigned a zero potential at all temperatures corresponding to the reaction \n\nThe standard hydrogen electrode consists of a platinum electrode coated with platinum black. The electrode is dipped in an acidic solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled through it. The concentration of both the reduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is maintained at unity (Fig. 2.3). This implies that the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar and the concentration of hydrogen ion in the solution is one molar. \n\nAt 298 K the emf of the cell, standard hydrogen electrode Il second half-cell constructed by taking standard hydrogen electrode as anode (reference half-cell) and the other half-cell as cathode, gives the reduction potential of the other half-cell.

The reverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu (or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion) under the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not dissolve in HCl. In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by hydrogen ion. The negative value of the standard electrode potential in the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or zinc can reduce hydrogen ions). \n\nIn view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in Fig. 2.1 can be written as: \n\nLeft electrode: $\\mathrm { Z n } ( \\mathrm { s } )  \\mathrm { Z n } ^ { 2 + }$ (aq, $\\mathrm { ~ 1 ~ M ~ 1 ~ 2 ~ e ~ } ^ { - }$ \n\nRight electrode: ${ \\mathrm { C u } } ^ { 2 + }$ (aq, $1 \\ \\mathrm { M } ) + 2 \\ \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }  \\mathrm { C u ( s ) }$ \n\nThe overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions and we obtain the equation: \n\nSometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes.

If the standard electrode potential of an electrode is greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to hydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative then hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species. It can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the highest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas $( \\mathrm { F _ { 2 } } )$ has the maximum tendency to get reduced to fluoride ions $( \\mathrm { F ^ { - } } )$ and therefore fluorine gas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest reducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating that lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is the most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be seen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2.1 the standard electrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising power of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of the species on the right hand side of the reaction.

Metals and their alloys have very large conductivity and are known as conductors. Certain non-metals like carbon-black, graphite and some organic polymers\\* are also electronically conducting.

Substances like silicon, doped silicon and gallium arsenide having conductivity between conductors and insulators are called semiconductors and are important electronic materials. Certain materials called superconductors by definition have zero resistivity or infinite conductivity.

However, for measuring the resistance of an ionic solution we face two problems. Firstly, passing direct current (DC) changes the composition of the solution. Secondly, a solution cannot be connected to the bridge like a metallic wire or other solid conductor. The first difficulty is resolved by using an alternating current (AC) source of power. The second problem is solved by using a specially designed vessel called conductivity cell. It is available in several designs and two simple ones are shown in Fig. 2.4. \n\nBasically it consists of two platinum electrodes coated with platinum black (finely divided metallic $\\mathrm { P t }$ is deposited on the electrodes electrochemically). These have area of cross section equal to $\\cdot _ { A } ,$ and are separated by distance $\\mathbf { \\nabla } ^ { \\cdot } l ^ { \\prime }$ . Therefore, solution confined between these electrodes is a column of length $l$ and area of cross section $A$ .The resistance of such a column of solution is then given by the equation: \n\nThe quantity $l / A$ is called cell constant denoted by the symbol, $G ^ { * }$ . It depends on the distance between the electrodes and their area of cross-section and has the dimension of length-' and can be calculated if we know I and A. Measurement of $l$ and $A$ is not only inconvenient but also unreliable. The cell constant is usually determined by measuring the resistance of the cell containing a solution whose conductivity is already known. For this purpose, we generally use KCl solutions whose conductivity is known accurately at various concentrations (Table 2.3) and at different temperatures. The cell constant, $G ^ { * }$ , is then given by the equation: \n\nOnce the cell constant is determined, we can use it for measuring the resistance or conductivity of any solution. The set up for the measurement of the resistance is shown in Fig. 2.5. \n\nIt consists of two resistances $R _ { 3 }$ and $R _ { 4 }$ ,a variable resistance $R _ { 1 }$ and the conductivity cell having the unknown resistance $R _ { 2 }$ .The wheatstone bridge is fed by an oscillator $\\mathrm { o }$ (a source of a.c. power in the audio frequency range 550 to 5000 cycles per second). $\\mathrm { P }$ is a suitable detector (a headphone or other electronic device) and the bridge is balanced when no current passes through the detector.

Conductivity always decreases with decrease in concentration both, for weak and strong electrolytes. This can be explained by the fact that the number of ions per unit volume that carry the current in a solution decreases on dilution. The conductivity of a solution at any given concentration is the conductance of one unit volume of solution kept between two platinum electrodes with unit area of cross section and at a distance of unit length. This is clear from the equation: \n\n$G = \\frac { \\kappa A } { l } = \\kappa$ = k (both A and l are unity in their appropriate units in 1 or cm) \n\nMolar conductivity of a solution at a given concentration is the conductance of the volume $V$ of solution containing one mole of electrolyte kept between two electrodes with area of cross section $A$ and distance of unit length. Therefore, \n\nSince $l = 1$ and $A = V$ ( volume containing 1 mole of electrolyte) \n\nMolar conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. This is because the total volume, $V ,$ of solution containing one mole of electrolyte also increases. It has been found that decrease in $\\kappa$ on dilution of a solution is more than compensated by increase in its volume. Physically, it means that at a given concentration, $\\Lambda _ { m }$ can be defined as the conductance of the electrolytic solution kept between the electrodes of a conductivity cell at unit distance but having area of cross section large enough to accommodate sufficient volume of solution that contains one mole of the electrolyte. when concentration approaches zero, the molar conductivity is known as limiting molar conductivity and is represented by the symbol $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ .The variation in $\\varLambda _ { m }$ with concentration is different (Fig. 2.6) for strong and weak electrolytes. \n\nStrong Electrolytes \n\nFor strong electrolytes, $\\boldsymbol { { \\Lambda } } _ { m }$ increases slowly with dilution and can be represented by the equation: \n\nIt can be seen that if we plot (Fig. 2.6) $\\varLambda _ { m }$ against $c",

This is the basis for an industrial process in which impure copper is converted into copper of high purity. The impure copper is made an anode that dissolves on passing current and pure copper is deposited at the cathode. Many metals like Na, Mg, Al, etc. are produced on large scale by electrochemical reduction of their respective cations where no suitable chemical reducing agents are available for this purpose. \n\nSodium and magnesium metals are produced by the electrolysis of their fused chlorides and aluminium is produced by electrolysis of aluminium oxide in presence of cryolite. \n\nQuantitative Aspects of Electrolysis \n\nMichael Faraday was the first scientist who described the quantitative aspects of electrolysis. Now Faraday's laws also flow from what has been discussed earlier. \n\nFaraday's Laws of Electrolysis \n\nAfter his extensive investigations on electrolysis of solutions and melts of electrolytes, Faraday published his results during 1833-34 in the form of the following well known Faraday's two laws of electrolysis: \n\n(i) First Law: The amount of chemical reaction which occurs at any electrode during electrolysis by a current is proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte (solution or melt).   \n(ii) Second Law: The amounts of different substances liberated by the same quantity of electricity passing through the electrolytic solution are proportional to their chemical equivalent weights (Atomic Mass of Metal $\\div$ Number of electrons required to reduce the cation). \n\nThere were no constant current sources available during Faraday's times. The general practice was to put a coulometer (a standard electrolytic cell) for determining the quantity of electricity passed from the amount of metal (generally silver or copper) deposited or consumed. However, coulometers are now obsolete and we now have constant current $\\left( I \\right)$ sources available and the quantity of electricity $Q$ , passed is given by \n\n$Q$ is in coloumbs when $I$ is in ampere and $t$ is in second. \n\nThe amount of electricity (or charge) required for oxidation or reduction depends on the stoichiometry of the electrode reaction. For example, in the reaction: \n\nOne mole of the electron is required for the reduction of one mole of silver ions. ▲ \n\nWe know that charge on one electron is equal to $1 . 6 0 2 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 1 9 } \\mathrm { C }$ \n\nTherefore, the charge on one mole of electrons is equal to: \n\nThis quantity of electricity is called Faraday and is represented by the symbol $\\mathbf { F }$ \n\nFor approximate calculations we use $1 { \\mathrm { F } } \\simeq 9 6 5 0 0 { \\mathrm { ~ C ~ m o l } } ^ { - 1 } .$ \n\nFor the electrode reactions: \n\nIt is obvious that one mole of $\\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ and ${ \\mathbb { A } } ^ { 3 + }$ require $2 \\mathrm { m o l }$ of electrons (2F) and $3 \\mathrm { m o l }$ of electrons (3F) respectively. The charge passed through the electrolytic cell during electrolysis is equal to the product of current in amperes and time in seconds. In commercial production of metals, current as high as 5o,ooo amperes are used that amounts to about 0.518 $\\mathrm { F }$ per second. - \n\nExample 2.10 \n\nA solution of $\\mathrm { C u S O _ { 4 } }$ is electrolysed for 10 minutes with a current of 1.5 amperes",

If the electrode is inert (e.g., platinum or gold), it does not participate in the chemical reaction and acts only as source or sink for electrons. On the other hand, if the electrode is reactive, it participates in the electrode reaction. Thus, the products of electrolysis may be different for reactive and inert electrodes.The products of electrolysis depend on the different oxidising and reducing species present in the electrolytic cell and their standard electrode potentials. Moreover, some of the electrochemical processes although feasible, are so slow kinetically that at lower voltages these do not seem to take place and extra potential (called overpotential has to be applied, which makes such process more difficult to occur. \n\nFor example, if we use molten NaCl, the products of electrolysis are sodium metal and $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ gas. Here we have only one cation $\\boldsymbol { ( \\mathrm { N a ^ { + } ) } }$ which is reduced at the cathode $\\mathrm { ( N a ^ { + } + e ^ { - }  N a ) }$ and one anion (Cl) which is oxidised at the anode $\\mathrm { ( C l ^ { - }  ^ { 1 } 2 C l _ { 2 } + e ^ { - } }$ ). During the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride solution, the products are NaOH, $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ . In this case besides $\\mathrm { N a } ^ { + }$ and $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ ions we also have $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ and $\\mathrm { O H } ^ { - }$ ions along with the solvent molecules, $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ . \n\nAt the cathode there is",

This is then used to run a turbine to produce electricity. We know that a galvanic cell directly converts chemical energy into electricity and is highly efficient. It is now possible to make such cells in which reactants are fed continuously to the electrodes and products are removed continuously from the electrolyte compartment. Galvanic cells that are designed to convert the energy of combustion of fuels like hydrogen, methane, methanol, etc. directly into electrical energy are called fuel cells. \n\nOne of the most successful fuel cells uses the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to form water (Fig. 2.12). The cell was used for providing electrical power in the Apollo space programme. The water vapours produced during the reaction were condensed and added to the drinking water supply for the astronauts. In the cell, hydrogen and oxygen are bubbled through porous carbon electrodes into concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. Catalysts like finely divided platinum or palladium metal are incorporated into the electrodes for increasing the rate of electrode reactions.

There has been tremendous progress in the development of new electrode materials, better catalysts and electrolytes for increasing the efficiency of fuel cells.

    "content": ", development of green coating on copper and bronze are some of the examples of corrosion. It causes enormous damage to buildings, bridges, ships and to all objects made of metals especially that of iron. We lose crores of rupees every year on account of corrosion. \n\nIn corrosion, a metal is oxidised by loss of electrons to oxygen and formation of oxides. Corrosion of iron (commonly known as rusting) occurs in presence of water and air. The chemistry of corrosion is quite complex but it may be considered essentially as an electrochemical phenomenon. At a particular spot (Fig. 2.13) of an object made of iron, oxidation takes place and that spot behaves as anode and we can write the reaction \n\nElectrons released at anodic spot move through the metal and go to another spot on the metal and reduce oxygen in the presence of $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ (which is believed to be available from $\\mathrm { { H _ { 2 } C O _ { 3 } } }$ formed due to dissolution of carbon dioxide from air into water. Hydrogen ion in water may also be available due to dissolution of other acidic oxides from the atmosphere). This spot behaves as cathode with the reaction \n\nThe overall reaction being: \n\nThe ferrous ions are further oxidised by atmospheric oxygen to ferric ions which come out as rust in the form of hydrated ferric oxide $( \\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 } . \\ x \\ \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } )$ and with further production of hydrogen ions. \n\nPrevention of corrosion is of prime importance. It not only saves money but also helps in preventing accidents such as a bridge collapse or failure of a key component due to corrosion. One of the simplest methods of preventing corrosion is to prevent the surface of the metallic object to come in contact with atmosphere. This can be done by covering the surface with paint or by some chemicals (e.g. bisphenol). Another simple method is to cover the surface by other metals (Sn, Zn, etc.) that are inert or react to save the object. An electrochemical method is to provide a sacrificial electrode of another metal (like Mg, Zn, etc.) which corrodes itself but saves the object. \n\nIntext Questions \n\n2.13 Write the chemistry of recharging the lead storage battery, highlighting all the materials that are involved during recharging. \n\n2.14 Suggest two materials other than hydrogen that can be used as fuels in fuel cells. \n\n2.15 Explain how rusting of iron is envisaged as setting up of an electrochemical cell. \n\nThe Hydrogen Economy \n\nAt present the main source of energy that is driving our economy is fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. As more people on the planet aspire to improve their standard of living, their energy requirement will increase. In fact, the per capita consumption of energy used is a measure of development. Of course, it is assumed that energy is used for productive purpose and not merely wasted. We are already aware that carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil fuels is resulting in the 'Greenhouse Effect'. This is leading to a rise in the temperature of the Earth's surface, causing polar ice to melt and ocean levels to rise. This will flood low-lying areas along the coast and some island nations such as Maldives face total submergence. In order to avoid such a catastrope, we need to limit our use of carbonaceous fuels. Hydrogen provides an ideal alternative as its combustion results in water only. Hydrogen production must come from splitting water using solar energy. Therefore, hydrogen can be used as a renewable and non polluting source of energy. This is the vision of the Hydrogen Economy. Both the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water and hydrogen combustion in a fuel cell will be important in the future",

Hydrogen provides an ideal alternative as its combustion results in water only. Hydrogen production must come from splitting water using solar energy. Therefore, hydrogen can be used as a renewable and non polluting source of energy. This is the vision of the Hydrogen Economy. Both the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water and hydrogen combustion in a fuel cell will be important in the future. And both these technologies are based on electrochemical principles. \n\nSummary \n\nAn electrochemical cell consists of two metalic electrodes dipping in electrolytic solution(s). Thus an important component of the electrochemical cell is the ionic conductor or electrolyte. Electrochemical cells are of two types. In galvanic cell, the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical work, whereas in an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to carry out a nonspontaneous redox reaction. The standard electrode potential for any electrode dipping in an appropriate solution is defined with respect to standard electrode potential of hydrogen electrode taken as zero. The standard potential of the cell an $\\ : [ \\ : E _ { \\mathrm { ( c e l l ) } } ^ { \\mathrm { o } } \\ : = \\ : E ^ { \\mathrm { o } } \\ :$ catie $E ^ { 0 }$ related to standard Gibbs energy $( \\Delta _ { r } G ^ { \\mathrm { o } } ~ = ~ - n F E _ { \\mathrm { ( c e l l ) } } ^ { \\mathrm { o } } )$ and equilibrium constant $( \\Delta _ { r } G ^ { \\mathrm { o } } = - \\ R T \\ln \\ K )$ of the reaction taking place in the cell. Concentration dependence of the potentials of the electrodes and the cells are given by Nernst equation. \n\nThe conductivity, $\\kappa ,$ of an electrolytic solution depends on the concentration of the electrolyte, nature of solvent and temperature. Molar conductivity, $\\varLambda _ { m }$ ,is defined by $\\quad = \\ \\kappa / c$ where $c$ is the concentration. Conductivity decreases but molar conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. It increases slowly with decrease in concentration for strong electrolytes while the increase is very steep for weak electrolytes in very dilute solutions. Kohlrausch found that molar conductivity at infinite dilution, for an electrolyte is sum of the contribution of the molar conductivity of the ions in which it dissociates. It is known as law of independent migration of ions and has many applications. Ions conduct electricity through the solution but oxidation and reduction of the ions take place at the electrodes in an electrochemical cell. Batteries and fuel cells are very useful forms of galvanic cell. Corrosion of metals is essentially an electrochemical phenomenon. Electrochemical principles are relevant to the Hydrogen Economy. \n\n2.1 Arrange the following metals in the order in which they displace each other from the solution of their salts.

The layout is horizontally oriented, showing two separate half-cells connected by a salt bridge. On the left side, there is a zinc electrode immersed in a solution containing Zn2+ ions, represented by a beaker labeled with Zn2+ ions and a Zn metal rod. On the right side, a copper electrode is immersed in a Cu2+ ion solution, similarly depicted with a beaker and a Cu metal rod. The salt bridge, typically a U-shaped tube filled with an electrolyte, connects the two solutions, allowing ion flow to maintain electrical neutrality. Arrows indicate the flow of electrons from the zinc electrode (anode) through an external wire to the copper electrode (cathode), demonstrating the direction of electron movement. The zinc electrode is labeled as the anode where oxidation occurs (Zn dissolves into Zn2+ ions), and the copper electrode is labeled as the cathode where reduction occurs (Cu2+ ions gain electrons and deposit as copper metal). The diagram includes voltage notation showing the cell potential of approximately 1.1 V under standard conditions (1 mol dm^-3 ion concentration). The background is plain white, and the colors used are realistic: metallic gray for electrodes, blue for the Zn2+ solution, and reddish-brown for the Cu2+ solution, enhancing clarity. The image uses clear, legible labels and arrows to explain the electrochemical processes, consistent with the surrounding text that discusses the Daniell cell's construction, function, and the flow of electrons and ions. This visual aids in understanding the conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy and the fundamental operation of galvanic cells, directly supporting the unit's objectives on electrochemical cells and their potentials.",

The layout consists of three distinct panels arranged horizontally, each depicting a different state of the electrochemical cell. Each panel shows a Daniell cell setup with two electrodes: a zinc (Zn) electrode on the left and a copper (Cu) electrode on the right, both immersed in their respective ionic solutions. The electrodes are connected externally by a wire, and a voltmeter is shown measuring the cell potential. The first panel (Fig. 2.2(a)) shows the Daniell cell operating spontaneously with electron flow from the zinc electrode (anode) to the copper electrode (cathode), generating an electrical current. The second panel (Fig. 2.2(b)) depicts the condition when the external voltage opposing the cell potential is increased to exactly 1.1 V, the standard emf of the Daniell cell. At this point, the reaction ceases, no electron flow occurs, and the voltmeter reads zero current. The third panel (Fig. 2.2(c)) illustrates the scenario where the external voltage exceeds 1.1 V, reversing the direction of electron flow and causing the cell to function as an electrolytic cell. Here, the non-spontaneous reaction is driven by the external power source, reversing the redox processes at the electrodes. The color scheme uses metallic gray for electrodes, blue for the copper sulfate solution, and a lighter blue or transparent color for the zinc sulfate solution, emphasizing the different electrolytes.

The composition is centered around a vertical cylindrical container filled with an acidic aqueous solution, indicated by a light blue color representing the electrolyte containing hydrogen ions (H+). A platinum electrode, shown as a solid black vertical rod, is immersed in the solution. The platinum electrode is coated with a textured layer labeled 'platinum black,' which increases the surface area for the redox reaction. At the top of the container, pure hydrogen gas (H2) is bubbled through a tube connected to the solution, represented by small bubbles rising from the electrode surface. The gas is maintained at a pressure of 1 bar, as indicated by a label near the gas inlet. The concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution is maintained at 1 molar, consistent with standard conditions. The diagram includes labels for each component: 'Pt electrode,' 'H2 gas (1 bar),' 'H+ (1 M),' and 'acidic solution.' The container is shown with a boundary line, and the interface between the platinum electrode and the electrolyte is clearly marked, emphasizing the electrode-electrolyte interface where the redox reaction occurs. The visual style is technical and schematic, using clear lines and color coding to distinguish elements. The lighting is uniform, typical of scientific diagrams, with no shadows or three-dimensional effects. The image relates directly to the surrounding text, which explains the function and construction of the Standard Hydrogen Electrode as a reference half-cell with zero electrode potential, used to measure the electrode potentials of other half-cells.

Here, $E^{\\mathrm{o}}$ denotes the overall standard cell potential, $E_{\\mathrm{R}}^{\\mathrm{o}}$ is the standard reduction potential of the cathode half-cell, and $E_{\\mathrm{L}}^{\\mathrm{o}}$ is the standard reduction potential of the anode half-cell. The equation involves subtraction of scalar quantities measured in volts (V), reflecting the potential difference driving electron flow in the electrochemical cell. This formulation is grounded in electrochemical conventions where the anode is placed on the left and the cathode on the right in cell notation. The standard electrode potentials are measured under standard conditions (1 M concentration, 1 bar pressure, 25°C) relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), which is assigned zero potential. The equation encapsulates the fundamental principle that the cell emf arises from the difference in the tendency of two half-reactions to gain electrons (reduction). It is central to understanding redox reactions, predicting spontaneity, and calculating thermodynamic properties such as Gibbs free energy change. This relationship is foundational in electrochemistry, linking half-cell potentials to the overall cell voltage, and is instrumental in applications including corrosion analysis, battery design, and electrochemical synthesis. The equation also serves as a precursor to the Nernst equation, which generalizes cell potential under non-standard conditions.",

The reactions include various elements and compounds such as F2, Cl2, MnO4-, O2, Ag+, Fe3+, Cu2+, H+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, and Li+, among others. The electrode potentials range from a high of +2.87 V for fluorine gas reduction to a low of -3.05 V for lithium ion reduction. Key patterns include a general decrease in electrode potential from top to bottom, indicating a decrease in oxidizing power of the species on the left and an increase in reducing power of the species on the right. Fluorine (F2) has the highest positive electrode potential, confirming it as the strongest oxidizing agent, while lithium ion has the lowest, making lithium metal the strongest reducing agent. The table supports the surrounding content by illustrating the concept that positive E° values correspond to species more stable in their reduced form than hydrogen gas, and negative values indicate species less stable than hydrogen gas. This data is fundamental for understanding redox behavior, predicting reaction spontaneity, and designing electrochemical cells, as discussed in the context. The table also underpins the explanation of the Nernst equation and its application in calculating electrode potentials under non-standard conditions.",

The reaction is: 2 Zn(s) + 2 Cu^{2+}(aq) → 2 Zn^{2+}(aq) + 2 Cu(s). The second part of the equation, Δ_rG = -4 F E_(cell), relates the Gibbs free energy change (Δ_rG) of the reaction to the electromotive force (emf) or cell potential (E_(cell)) of the galvanic cell. Here, Δ_rG is the Gibbs energy change for the reaction, F is the Faraday constant (approximately 96485 C/mol), and the factor 4 corresponds to the total number of moles of electrons transferred (n=4) in the balanced redox reaction. The negative sign indicates that a positive cell potential corresponds to a spontaneous reaction with a decrease in Gibbs free energy. Mathematically, this equation is derived from the fundamental thermodynamic relationship connecting electrical work and chemical energy, where the maximum non-expansion work obtainable from the cell equals the decrease in Gibbs free energy. This equation is central in electrochemistry, linking measurable electrical quantities to thermodynamic properties, enabling calculation of reaction spontaneity, equilibrium constants, and energy changes. It also connects to the Nernst equation and standard electrode potentials discussed in the surrounding context. Practically, it is used to determine the maximum electrical work obtainable from galvanic cells and to relate cell potentials to thermodynamic data in chemical and industrial processes.",

Mathematically, resistance R is directly proportional to the length l of the conductor and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area A. The proportionality constant p (rho) is the resistivity, an intrinsic material property that quantifies how strongly the material opposes electric current. Formally, R = p * (l / A). Here, R is measured in ohms (Ω), l in meters (m), A in square meters (m²), and p in ohm-meters (Ω·m).

It underpins the design and analysis of electrical circuits and components, enabling calculation of resistance from physical dimensions and material type.

The layout is a side-by-side comparison of two schematic diagrams, each illustrating a conductivity cell with labeled components. Both cells consist of a container holding an ionic solution, with two platinum electrodes immersed in the solution. The electrodes are coated with platinum black, depicted as textured or shaded areas on the electrode surfaces to indicate the finely divided metallic platinum coating. The electrodes are positioned parallel to each other, separated by a defined distance, representing the length 'l' of the solution column between them. The cross-sectional area 'A' of the electrodes is implied by their shape and size in the diagrams. The first cell design shows a simple cylindrical vessel with two flat electrodes facing each other inside the solution. The second design appears more complex, possibly with a different electrode arrangement or vessel shape, but still maintains the fundamental principle of two electrodes immersed in the solution. The diagrams use clean, technical line art with black lines on a white background, emphasizing clarity and precision typical of scientific illustrations. There are no colors beyond black and white, and the lighting is uniform, as the image is a schematic rather than a photograph. The image directly relates to the surrounding text discussing the measurement of conductivity in ionic solutions, the use of alternating current to avoid electrochemical changes, and the importance of the cell constant determined by electrode geometry. The visual elements support understanding of how the conductivity cell confines the solution between electrodes, enabling resistance measurement. The image is technical, focusing on the physical setup rather than dynamic activity, and serves as a foundational reference for the subsequent explanation of conductivity measurement techniques and calculations.",

Here, R denotes the resistance measured in ohms (\\Omega), l is the length of the conductive path (distance between electrodes) in meters, and A is the cross-sectional area perpendicular to current flow in square meters. The parameter \\rho represents the resistivity of the material, a fundamental physical property quantifying how strongly the material opposes electric current, measured in ohm-meters (\\Omega\\cdot m). The conductivity \\kappa is the reciprocal of resistivity (\\kappa = 1/\\rho), measured in siemens per meter (S/m), indicating the material's ability to conduct electric current. The equation shows that resistance is directly proportional to the length and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area and conductivity. This relationship is foundational in characterizing electrical conduction in materials, linking macroscopic measurable quantities (R, l, A) to intrinsic material properties (\\rho, \\kappa). In the context of ionic solutions and conductivity cells, this equation models the resistance of the solution column confined between electrodes, enabling determination of conductivity from measured resistance and known cell geometry. The cell constant G* = l/A encapsulates the geometric factors, facilitating practical conductivity measurements. This equation is central to electrochemistry, materials science, and electrical engineering, underpinning the classification of materials as conductors, semiconductors, or insulators based on their conductivity. It also relates to the use of Wheatstone bridges and AC measurement techniques to accurately determine solution resistances without altering solution composition. Overall, it bridges theoretical concepts of resistivity and conductivity with experimental methodologies for characterizing electrical properties of materials and electrolytic solutions.",

The first row serves as headers describing the units and parameters measured. Concentration is given in mol L^-1 and mol m^-3, conductivity is presented in S cm^-1 and S m^-1, and molar conductivity is shown in S cm^2 mol^-1 and S m^2 mol^-1. The data points include concentrations of 1.000 and 0.100 mol L^-1 (1000 and 100 mol m^-3), with corresponding conductivities of 0.1113 and 0.0129 S cm^-1 (11.13 and 1.29 S m^-1), and molar conductivities of 111.3 and 129.0 S cm^2 mol^-1 (111.3×10^-4 and 129.0×10^-4 S m^2 mol^-1). The table reveals that as concentration decreases from 1.000 to 0.100 mol L^-1, conductivity decreases significantly, but molar conductivity increases, indicating that ions move more freely at lower concentrations due to reduced ion-ion interactions. This trend aligns with the surrounding context explaining that conductivity depends on ion concentration, size, and mobility. The table supports the concept that molar conductivity is a more physically meaningful measure than conductivity alone, as it normalizes conductivity by concentration, reflecting ion mobility and dissociation efficiency. The data also illustrate the practical use of KCl solutions with known conductivity values to determine the cell constant in conductivity measurements, as discussed in the text. Overall, the table provides quantitative backing for the theoretical explanations of ionic conductance, measurement techniques, and the importance of molar conductivity in electrolyte solutions.",

The layout is a classic Wheatstone bridge configuration with four resistors arranged in a diamond shape. The top left resistor is labeled R1 and is a variable resistor, the top right resistor is labeled R2 and represents the conductivity cell containing the unknown electrolyte solution, the bottom left resistor is labeled R3, and the bottom right resistor is labeled R4. An oscillator labeled 'o' provides an alternating current (AC) source connected across the bridge. A detector labeled 'P' (which could be a headphone or electronic device) is connected between the two opposite junctions of the bridge to detect current flow. The bridge is balanced when no current passes through the detector, allowing calculation of the unknown resistance R2 using the formula R2 = (R1 * R4) / R3. The diagram uses simple black lines on a white background with clear labels for each component. The conductivity cell (R2) is visually distinguished as a rectangular box, indicating it contains the electrolyte solution. The oscillator and detector are represented by standard electrical symbols. The image is technical and schematic, focusing on clarity and functional relationships rather than artistic style. This visual directly relates to the surrounding text on page 12, which explains the challenges of measuring ionic solution resistance and the use of AC and conductivity cells in the Wheatstone bridge method. The image supports understanding of the measurement setup described in the text, illustrating how the unknown resistance of the electrolyte solution is integrated into the Wheatstone bridge circuit for accurate measurement without altering the solution's composition.",

Mathematically, the cell constant G* (with units of m^-1) divided by the resistance R (ohms) yields the conductivity κ (S m^-1) of the solution, expressed as κ = G*/R. Here, G* is a known constant determined from a standard solution, and R is the measured resistance of the unknown solution. The concentration c is converted from mol L^-1 to mol m^-3 by multiplying by 1000, reflecting unit consistency in SI. The molar conductivity Λ_m (S m^2 mol^-1) is then calculated by dividing the conductivity κ by the concentration c, Λ_m = κ/c. The equation shows numerical substitution: G*/R = 1299/5 = 0.248 S m^-1, concentration c = 0.02 mol L^-1 × 1000 = 20 mol m^-3, and molar conductivity Λ_m = 0.248 / 20 = 1.24 × 10^-4 S m^2 mol^-1.

Here, r is specified as 0.5 cm, and π is approximated as 3.14. The calculation proceeds by squaring the radius (0.5 cm)² = 0.25 cm², multiplying by π to yield 0.785 cm², and then converting this area into square meters (0.785 × 10⁻⁴ m²) to maintain SI unit consistency.

Here, κ denotes the conductivity of the solution, a measure of its ability to conduct electric current. The variables are: κ (conductivity, Siemens per cm), A (cross-sectional area of the cell, cm²), and l (distance between electrodes, cm). Since A = 1 cm² and l = 1 cm, the conductance simplifies directly to κ. This equation is fundamental in electrochemistry for relating measurable conductance to intrinsic conductivity, enabling calculation of molar conductivity and resistivity. It underpins the analysis of how conductivity varies with electrolyte concentration, crucial for characterizing strong and weak electrolytes. The equation connects to the broader framework of electrolyte solution behavior, facilitating interpretation of experimental data such as the variation of molar conductivity with concentration and the determination of limiting molar conductivity. It also serves as a basis for practical applications in chemical analysis, quality control, and understanding ion transport phenomena in solutions.",

The y-axis is labeled with values ranging approximately from 0 to 400 S cm² mol⁻¹, and the x-axis ranges from 0 to about 0.1 (mol/L)^1/2. Two distinct curves are shown: one for acetic acid, a weak electrolyte, and one for potassium chloride (KCl), a strong electrolyte. The curve for KCl shows a nearly linear increase in molar conductivity as concentration decreases (moving left on the x-axis), consistent with the theory that molar conductivity increases slowly with dilution for strong electrolytes. The acetic acid curve shows a more pronounced increase in molar conductivity with dilution, reflecting the different behavior of weak electrolytes. The graph uses different colors or line styles to distinguish the two electrolytes, with clear data points marked along each curve. The background is white with grid lines to aid in reading values.

Mathematically, it states that the difference between the limiting molar conductivity of KCl and NaCl equals that of KBr and NaBr, which also equals that of KI and NaI, approximately 23.4 S cm^2 mol^{-1}. Here, \\( \\mathring{\\Lambda}_m \\) denotes the limiting molar conductivity, representing the conductivity contribution per mole of electrolyte at infinite dilution where ion interactions are negligible. The variables correspond to specific electrolytes: KCl, NaCl, KBr, NaBr, KI, and NaI. The operations involve subtraction of scalar conductivity values, highlighting a linear relationship. This empirical regularity underpins Kohlrausch's law of independent migration of ions, which states that the limiting molar conductivity of an electrolyte is the sum of the individual ionic contributions. Physically, this reflects that the difference in conductivity arises primarily from the difference in cation mobilities (K^+ vs Na^+), as the anion is held constant. The equation is significant in electrochemistry and physical chemistry for understanding ionic transport and validating the additivity of ionic conductivities. It relates to other concepts such as the determination of limiting molar conductivities, degree of dissociation, and the use of plots of molar conductivity versus square root of concentration to extrapolate infinite dilution values. Practically, it aids in calculating ionic conductivities for various electrolytes, predicting solution behavior, and designing experiments involving electrolyte solutions.

The notation \\( \\mathring{\\Lambda}_m \\) denotes the limiting molar conductivity, which is the molar conductivity at infinite dilution where ion interactions are negligible. The equation states that the difference between the limiting molar conductivities of NaBr and NaCl is approximately equal to the difference between those of KBr and KCl, both being about 1.8 S cm² mol⁻¹.

It supports the theoretical framework that the total limiting molar conductivity of an electrolyte is the sum of the individual ionic contributions, facilitating calculations for electrolytes where direct measurement is difficult.

The first column lists cations such as H⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, and Mg²⁺, while the third column lists anions including OH⁻, Cl⁻, Br⁻, and CH₃COO⁻. The λ values represent the limiting molar conductivities of individual ions at infinite dilution and 298 K, crucial for applying Kohlrausch's law of independent migration of ions. Key data points include the exceptionally high λ value for H⁺ (349.6 S cm² mol⁻¹) and OH⁻ (199.1 S cm² mol⁻¹), reflecting their high ionic mobility. Na⁺ and K⁺ ions show multiple λ values (50.1, 73.5, 119.0 S cm² mol⁻¹), possibly indicating different measurement conditions or sources. Mg²⁺ has a λ of 106.0 S cm² mol⁻¹, while common anions like Cl⁻ and Br⁻ have λ values of 76.3 and 78.1 S cm² mol⁻¹ respectively. The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) has a lower λ of 40.9 S cm² mol⁻¹, consistent with its larger size and lower mobility. The table supports the surrounding content by providing the fundamental ionic conductivity values needed to calculate limiting molar conductivities (Λₘ°) of electrolytes using Kohlrausch's law. This enables determination of Λₘ° for strong electrolytes like KCl and weak electrolytes like acetic acid, as discussed in the text. The data also illustrate the principle that the total limiting molar conductivity of an electrolyte is the sum of its constituent ions' λ values, underpinning the law of independent migration of ions. The table's values are essential for plotting Λₘ versus c¹/² to verify linearity and extract parameters such as Λₘ° and the constant A for KCl, as well as for calculating dissociation constants of weak electrolytes.",

Mathematically, it states that the total electric charge Q (measured in coulombs) passing through an electrolytic cell is the product of the constant current I (in amperes) and the duration t (in seconds) for which the current flows. Here, Q is the total charge transferred, I is the steady current supplied by an external source, and t is the elapsed time of electrolysis. This linear relationship is a direct consequence of the definition of electric current as the rate of flow of charge (I = dQ/dt). The equation is foundational in electrochemistry, particularly in quantifying the amount of substance deposited or dissolved at electrodes during electrolysis, as per Faraday's laws. It connects the macroscopic measurable quantities (current and time) to the microscopic transfer of electrons involved in redox reactions.

Mathematically, it is a balanced redox half-equation showing conservation of mass and charge: 2 molecules of H2 gas combine with 4 hydroxide ions to yield 4 water molecules and 4 electrons. Variables include H2(g) denoting hydrogen gas, OH-(aq) hydroxide ions in aqueous phase, H2O(l) liquid water, and e- electrons. The reaction involves stoichiometric coefficients ensuring atom and charge balance, illustrating electron transfer fundamental to electrochemical energy conversion. This half-reaction is part of the overall fuel cell reaction converting chemical energy directly into electrical energy with high efficiency, relevant in the context of fuel cells discussed on pages 24-26. The electrons produced flow through an external circuit generating electric current, while the water formed is a benign byproduct. This equation is critical in understanding the electrochemical mechanism of hydrogen oxidation in alkaline media, linking to the broader framework of sustainable energy technologies and pollution-free power generation. It relates to other electrode reactions and overall cell reactions mentioned, such as the oxygen reduction cathode reaction and the overall hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell reaction.

The composition is divided into several interconnected sections showing the microscopic and chemical interactions on the iron surface. At the center, a metallic iron surface is depicted with distinct anodic and cathodic regions. The anodic spot is marked where iron atoms lose electrons (oxidation), forming ferrous ions (Fe2+). These electrons travel through the metal to the cathodic spot, where oxygen from the atmosphere reacts with water and hydrogen ions (H+) to form hydroxide ions (OH-), representing the reduction reaction. The diagram includes arrows indicating electron flow from the anode to the cathode and ion movement in the electrolyte layer. Surrounding the iron surface, the presence of water (H2O) and dissolved oxygen (O2) is shown, emphasizing their role in the corrosion process. The formation of hydrated ferric oxide (Fe2O3.xH2O), commonly known as rust, is illustrated as a reddish-brown layer coating the iron surface, indicating the end product of the corrosion reaction. The image uses color coding: metallic iron is shown in gray, rust in reddish-brown, water in blue, and oxygen molecules in red and white. The lighting and style are schematic and educational, with clear labels and chemical equations adjacent to the relevant parts of the diagram. This visual representation directly relates to the surrounding text explaining the electrochemical nature of corrosion, the oxidation and reduction reactions involved, and the environmental factors contributing to rust formation. It serves as a technical aid to understand how corrosion acts as a localized electrochemical cell, reinforcing the theoretical content on page 25 about corrosion chemistry and prevention methods.",

The equation relates to the broader discussion of electrochemical cells, redox reactions, and corrosion phenomena described in the context, linking thermodynamic properties (Gibbs free energy) to measurable electrical potentials. It also connects to the Nernst equation, which adjusts electrode potentials based on ion concentrations, and to practical applications such as corrosion prevention and fuel cell technology.

The standard Gibbs free energy change, given as \\(-45.54\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}\\), quantifies the spontaneity of the reaction under standard conditions (1 bar, 298 K, 1 M concentrations). A negative value indicates the reaction proceeds spontaneously in the forward direction. The equilibrium constant \\( K_c = 9.62 \\times 10^{7} \\) is a dimensionless quantity representing the ratio of product to reactant concentrations at equilibrium, reflecting a strong product-favored equilibrium. These two quantities are mathematically related by the fundamental thermodynamic equation \\( \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}} G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K_c \\), where \\( R \\) is the universal gas constant and \\( T \\) the absolute temperature. Here, \\( \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}} G^{\\circ} \\) and \\( K_c \\) are consistent, confirming the reaction's thermodynamic favorability. The variables include \\( \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}} G^{\\circ} \\) (standard Gibbs free energy change), \\( K_c \\) (equilibrium constant), \\( R \\) (gas constant), and \\( T \\) (temperature in Kelvin). The equation arises in the context of redox reactions and galvanic cells, where calculating \\( \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}} G^{\\circ} \\) and \\( K_c \\) helps predict reaction spontaneity and equilibrium position. This relationship is fundamental in electrochemistry, chemical thermodynamics, and kinetics, providing insight into reaction feasibility, cell potential, and equilibrium composition. Practically, it aids in designing galvanic cells, batteries, and understanding corrosion and electrolysis processes. Within the broader framework, this equation links thermodynamic potentials to measurable equilibrium constants, bridging chemical energetics and reaction dynamics.",

    "content": "Objectives \n\nAfter studying this Unit, you will be able to \n\ndefine the average and instantaneous rate of a reaction; express the rate of a reaction in terms of change in concentration of either of the reactants or products with time; ● distinguish between elementary and complex reactions; ● differentiate between the molecularity and order of a reaction; define rate constant; ● discuss the dependence of rate of reactions on concentration, temperature and catalyst; derive integrated rate equations for the zero and first order reactions; ● determine the rate constants for zeroth and first order reactions; ● describe collision theory. \n\nChemical Kinetics helps us to understand how chemical reactions occur. \n\nChemistry, by its very nature, is concerned with change. Substances with well defined properties are converted by chemical reactions into other substances with different properties. For any chemical reaction, chemists try to find out - \n\n(a) the feasibility of a chemical reaction which can be predicted by thermodynamics ( as you know that a reaction with $\\Delta \\mathrm { G } < 0$ , at constant temperature and pressure is feasible);   \n(b) extent to which a reaction will proceed can be determined from chemical equilibrium;   \n(c) speed of a reaction i.e. time taken by a reaction to reach equilibrium. \n\nAlong with feasibility and extent, it is equally important to know the rate and the factors controlling the rate of a chemical reaction for its complete understanding. For example, which parameters determine as to how rapidly food gets spoiled? How to design a rapidly setting material for dental filling? Or what controls the rate at which fuel burns in an auto engine? All these questions can be answered by the branch of chemistry, which deals with the study of reaction rates and their mechanisms, called chemical kinetics. The word kinetics is derived from the Greek word kinesis' meaning movement. Thermodynamics tells only about the feasibility of a reaction whereas chemical kinetics tells about the rate of a reaction. For example, thermodynamic data indicate that diamond shall convert to graphite but in reality the conversion rate is so slow that the change is not perceptible at all. Therefore, most people think that diamond is forever. Kinetic studies not only help us to determine the speed or rate of a chemical reaction but also describe the conditions by which the reaction rates can be altered. The factors such as concentration, temperature, pressure and catalyst affect the rate of a reaction. At the macroscopic level, we are interested in amounts reacted or formed and the rates of their consumption or formation. At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving orientation and energy of molecules undergoing collisions, are discussed. \n\nIn this Unit, we shall be dealing with average and instantaneous rate of reaction and the factors affecting these. Some elementary ideas about the collision theory of reaction rates are also given. However, in order to understand all these, let us first learn about the reaction rate. \n\nSome reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example, precipitation of silver chloride occurs instantaneously by mixing of aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride, On the other hand, some reactions are very slow, for example, rusting of iron in the presence of air and moisture. Also there are reactions like inversion of cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate speed. Can you think of more examples from each category? \n\nYou must be knowing that speed of an automobile is expressed in terms of change in the position or distance covered by it in a certain period of time. Similarly, the speed of a reaction or the rate of a reaction can be defined as the change in concentration of a reactant or product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in terms of: \n\n(i) the rate of decrease in concentration of any one of the reactants, or   \n(ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products. Consider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the   \nsystem remains constant. \n\nOne mole of the reactant $\\mathrm {",

    "content": "of a reaction or the rate of a reaction can be defined as the change in concentration of a reactant or product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in terms of: \n\n(i) the rate of decrease in concentration of any one of the reactants, or   \n(ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products. Consider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the   \nsystem remains constant. \n\nOne mole of the reactant $\\mathrm { R }$ produces one mole of the product P. If $[ \\mathrm { R } ] _ { 1 }$ and $[ \\mathrm { P l } _ { 1 }$ are the concentrations of R and $\\mathrm { P }$ respectively at time $\\mathbf { t } _ { 1 }$ and $\\left[ \\operatorname { R } \\right] _ { 2 }$ and $[ \\mathrm { P l } _ { 2 }$ are their concentrations at time $\\mathrm { t } _ { 2 }$ then, \n\nThe square brackets in the above expressions are used to express molar concentration. \n\nRate of disappearance of R \n\nRate of appearance of P \n\nSince, $\\Delta [ \\mathrm { R } ]$ is a negative quantity (as concentration of reactants is decreasing), it is multiplied with $^ { - 1 }$ to make the rate of the reaction a positive quantity. \n\nEquations (3. 1) and (3.2) given above represent the average rate of a reaction, Tav. \n\nAverage rate depends upon the change in concentration of reactants or products and the time taken for that change to occur (Fig. 3.1). \n\nUnits of rate of a reaction \n\nFrom equations (3.1) and (3.2), it is clear that units of rate are concentration $\\mathrm { t i m e ^ { - 1 } }$ . For example, if concentration is in $\\mathrm { m o l ~ L ^ { - 1 } }$ and time is in seconds then the units will be mol $\\mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 } \\mathbf { S } ^ { - 1 }$ .

The representation of rate of reaction in terms of concentration of the reactants is known as rate law. It is also called as rate equation or rate expression. \n\n3.2.2 Rate Expression and Rate Constant \n\nThe results in Table 3.1 clearly show that rate of a reaction decreases with the passage of time as the concentration of reactants decrease. Conversely, rates generally increase when reactant concentrations increase. So, rate of a reaction depends upon the concentration of reactants. \n\nConsider a general reaction \n\nwhere a, b, c and d are the stoichiometric coefficients of reactants and products. \n\nThe rate expression for this reaction is \n\nRate $\\propto [ \\mathrm { A } ] ^ { \\mathrm { x } } [ \\mathrm { B } ] ^ { \\mathrm { y } }$ \n\nwhere exponents $\\mathbf { x }$ and y may or may not be equal to the stoichiometric coefficients (a and b) of the reactants. Above equation can also be written as \n\nThis form of equation $_ { ( 3 . 4 \\mathrm { ~ b ~ } ) }$ is known as differential rate equation, where $k$ is a proportionality constant called rate constant. The equation like (3.4), which relates the rate of a reaction to concentration of reactants is called rate law or rate expression. Thus, rate law is the expression in which reaction rate is given in terms of molar concentration of reactants with each term raised to some power, which may or may not be same as the stoichiometric coefficient of the reacting species in a balanced chemical equation. For example: - \n\nWe can measure the rate of this reaction as a function of initial concentrations either by keeping the concentration of one of the reactants constant and changing the concentration of the other reactant or by changing the concentration of both the reactants.

The number of reacting species (atoms, ions or molecules) taking part in an elementary reaction, which must collide simultaneously in order to bring about a chemical reaction is called molecularity of a reaction. The reaction can be unimolecular when one reacting species is involved, for example, decomposition of ammonium nitrite. \n\nBimolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between two species, for example, dissociation of hydrogen iodide. \n\nTrimolecular or termolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between three reacting species, for example, \n\nThe probability that more than three molecules can collide and react simultaneously is very small. Hence, reactions with the molecularity three are very rare and slow to proceed. \n\nIt is, therefore, evident that complex reactions involving more than three molecules in the stoichiometric equation must take place in more than one step. \n\nThis reaction which apparently seems to be of tenth order is actually a second order reaction. This shows that this reaction takes place in several steps. which step controls the rate of the overall reaction? The question can be answered if we go through the mechanism of reaction, for example, chances to win the relay race competition by a team depend upon the slowest person in the team. Similarly, the overall rate of the reaction is controlled by the slowest step in a reaction called the rate determining step. Consider the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide which is catalysed by iodide ion in an alkaline medium. \n\nThe rate equation for this reaction is found to be \n\nThis reaction is first order with respect to both $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ and $\\Gamma$ . Evidences suggest that this reaction takes place in two steps \n\nBoth the steps are bimolecular elementary reactions. Species IO' is called as an intermediate since it is formed during the course of the reaction but not in the overall balanced equation. The first step, being slow, is the rate determining step. Thus, the rate of formation of intermediate will determine the rate of this reaction. \n\nThus, from the discussion, til now, we conclude the following: \n\n(i) Order of a reaction is an experimental quantity. It can be zero and even a fraction but molecularity cannot be zero or a non integer.   \n(ii) Order is applicable to elementary as well as complex reactions whereas molecularity is applicable only for elementary reactions.

If concentration of X is increased to three times how will it affect the rate of formation of Y? \n\n3.3 Integrated Rate Equations \n\nWe have already noted that the concentration dependence of rate is called differential rate equation. It is not always convenient to determine the instantaneous rate, as it is measured by determination of slope of the tangent at point $^ { \\bullet } t$ in concentration vs time plot (Fig. 3. 1). This makes it difficult to determine the rate law and hence the order of the reaction. In order to avoid this difficulty, we can integrate the differential rate equation to give a relation between directly measured experimental data, i.e., concentrations at different times and rate constant. \n\nThe integrated rate equations are different for the reactions of different reaction orders. We shall determine these equations only for zero and first order chemical reactions. \n\n3.3.1 Zero Order Reactions \n\nZero order reaction means that the rate of the reaction is proportional to zero power of the concentration of reactants. Consider the reaction, \n\nR → P \n\nAs any quantity raised to power zero is unity \n\nIntegrating both sides \n\nwhere, I is the constant of integration. \n\nAt $t = 0$ , the concentration of the reactant $\\mathrm { R } = \\left[ \\mathrm { R } \\right] _ { 0 }$ where $[ \\mathrm { R } ] _ { 0 }$ is initial concentration of the reactant. \n\nSubstituting in equation (3.5) \n\nSubstituting the value of I in the equation (3.5) \n\nComparing (3.6) with equation of a straight line, $\\mathbf { y } = \\mathbf { m } \\mathbf { x } + \\mathbf { c }$ , if we plot [R] against t, we get a straight line (Fig. 3.3) with slope $\\ c = - k$ and intercept equal to $\\left[ \\operatorname { R } \\right] _ { 0 }$ \n\nFurther simplifying equation (3.6), we get the rate constant, $k$ as \n\nZero order reactions are relatively uncommon but they occur under special conditions. Some enzyme catalysed reactions and reactions which occur on metal surfaces are a few examples of zero order reactions. The decomposition of gaseous ammonia on a hot platinum surface is a zero order reaction at high pressure. \n\nIn this reaction, platinum metal acts as a catalyst. At high pressure, the metal surface gets saturated with gas molecules. So, a further change in reaction conditions is unable to alter the amount of ammonia on the surface of the catalyst making rate of the reaction independent of its concentration. The thermal decomposition of HI on gold surface is another example of zero order reaction. \n\n3.3.2 First Order Reactions \n\nIn this class of reactions, the rate of the reaction is proportional to the first power of the concentration of the reactant R.

There are many reactions which obey first order rate law although they are higher order reactions. Consider the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate which is a chemical reaction between ethyl acetate and water. In reality, it is a second order reaction and concentration of both ethyl acetate and water affect the rate of the reaction. But water is taken in large excess for hydrolysis, therefore, concentration of water is not altered much during the reaction. Thus, the rate of reaction is affected by concentration of ethyl acetate only. For example, during the hydrolysis of $0 . 0 1 \\mathrm { \\ m o l }$ of ethyl acetate with $1 0 \\mathrm { \\ m o l }$ of water, amounts of the reactants and products at the beginning $\\left( t = 0 \\right]$ and completion (t) of the reaction are given as under. \n\nThe concentration of water does not get altered much during the course of the reaction. So, the reaction behaves as first order reaction. Such reactions are called pseudo first order reactions. \n\nInversion of cane sugar is another pseudo first order reaction. \n\nC12H22O11 + H_₂O \\$H+\\$ + CfH12O6 Cane sugar Glucose Fructose Rate = k [C12H22011 \n\nIntext Questions \n\n3.5 A first order reaction has a rate constant $1 . 1 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \\mathrm { s ^ { - 1 } }$ .

If the decomposition is a first order reaction, calculate the rate constant of the reaction. \n\n3.4 Temperature Dependence of the Rate of a Reaction \n\nMost of the chemical reactions are accelerated by increase in temperature. For example, in decomposition of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 }$ , the time taken for half of the original amount of material to decompose is $1 2 \\ \\mathrm { m i n }$ at $5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , $^ { 5 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ at $2 5 \\mathrm { { ^ \\circ C } }$ and 10 days at $0 \\%$ .

It was first proposed by Dutch chemist, J.H. van't Hoff but Swedish chemist, Arrhenius provided its physical justification and interpretation. \n\nwhere $A$ is the Arrhenius factor or the frequency factor. It is also called pre-exponential factor. It is a constant specific to a particular reaction. $R$ is gas constant and $E _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ is activation energy measured in joules/mole $( \\mathrm { J \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } } )$ . \n\nIt can be understood clearly using the following simple reaction \n\nAccording to Arrhenius, this reaction can take place only when a molecule of hydrogen and a molecule of iodine collide to form an unstable intermediate (Fig. 3.6). It exists for a very short time and then breaks up to form two molecules of hydrogen iodide. \n\nThe energy required to form this intermediate, called activated complex (C), is known as activation energy $( \\pmb { { \\cal E } } _ { \\mathbf { a } } )$ . Fig. 3.7 is obtained by plotting potential energy vs reaction coordinate. Reaction coordinate represents the profile of energy change when reactants change into products. \n\nSome energy is released when the complex decomposes to form products. So, the final enthalpy of the reaction depends upon the nature of reactants and products. ▲ \n\nAll the molecules in the reacting species do not have the same kinetic energy. Since it is difficult to predict the behaviour of any one molecule with precision, Ludwig Boltzmann and James Clark Maxwell used statistics to predict the behaviour of large number of molecules. According to them, the distribution of kinetic energy may be described by plotting the fraction of molecules $( N _ { \\mathrm { E } } / N _ { \\mathrm { T } } )$ with a given kinetic energy $\\mathrm { ( E ) }$ vs kinetic energy (Fig. 3.8). Here, $N _ { \\mathrm { E } }$ is the number of molecules with energy $E$ and $N _ { \\mathrm { { T } } }$ is total number of molecules. \n\nThe peak of the curve corresponds to the most probable kinetic energy, i.e., kinetic energy of maximum fraction of molecules. There are decreasing number of molecules with energies higher or lower than this value. When the temperature is raised, the maximum of the curve moves to the higher energy value (Fig. 3.9) and the curve broadens out, i.e., spreads to the right such that there is a greater proportion of molecules with much higher energies. The area under the curve must be constant since total probability must be one at all times. We can mark the position of $E _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ on Maxwell Boltzmann distribution curve (Fig. 3.9). \n\nIncreasing the temperature of the substance increases the fraction of molecules, which collide with energies greater than $E _ { \\mathrm { a } } . \\ \\mathrm { I t }$ is clear from the diagram that in the curve at $\\left( t + \\ 1 0 \\right)$ , the area showing the fraction of molecules having energy equal to or greater than activation energy gets doubled leading to doubling the rate of a reaction. \n\nIn the Arrhenius equation (3.18) the factor $\\mathrm { e } ^ { - E \\mathrm { a } \\ / R T }$ corresponds to the fraction of molecules that have kinetic energy greater than $E _",

A catalyst does not alter Gibbs energy, ∆G of a reaction. It catalyses the spontaneous reactions but does not catalyse non-spontaneous reactions. It is also found that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium constant of a reaction rather, it helps in attaining the equilibrium faster, that is, it catalyses the forward as well as the backward reactions to the same extent so that the equilibrium state remains same but is reached earlier. \n\nThough Arrhenius equation is applicable under a wide range of circumstances, collision theory, which was developed by Max Trautz and William Lewis in 1916 -18, provides a greater insight into the energetic and mechanistic aspects of reactions. It is based on kinetic theory of gases. According to this theory, the reactant molecules are assumed to be hard spheres and reaction is postulated to occur when molecules collide with each other. The number of collisions per second per unit volume of the reaction mixture is known as collision frequency $\\mathbf { ( } \\mathbf { Z } \\mathbf { ) }$ . Another factor which affects the rate of chemical reactions is activation energy (as we have already studied). For a bimolecular elementary reaction \n\nrate of reaction can be expressed as \n\nwhere $Z _ { \\mathrm { A B } }$ represents the collision frequency of reactants, A and B and e-Ea /R represents the fraction of molecules with energies equal to or greater than $E _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ . Comparing (3.23) with Arrhenius equation, we can say that $A$ is related to collision frequency. \n\nEquation (3.23) predicts the value of rate constants fairly accurately for the reactions that involve atomic species or simple molecules but for complex molecules significant deviations are observed. The reason could be that all collisions do not lead to the formation of products. The collisions in which molecules collide with sufficient kinetic energy (called threshold energy\\*) and proper orientation, so as to facilitate breaking of bonds between reacting species and formation of new bonds to form products are called as effective collisions. \n\nFor example, formation of methanol from bromoethane depends upon the orientation of reactant molecules as shown in Fig. 3.12. The proper orientation of reactant molecules lead to bond formation whereas improper orientation makes them simply bounce back and no products are formed. \n\nTo account for effective collisions, another factor $P _ { \\ast }$ , called the probability or steric factor is introduced. It takes into account the fact that in a collision, molecules must be properly oriented i.e., \n\nThus, in collision theory activation energy and proper orientation of the molecules together determine the criteria for an effective collision and hence the rate of a chemical reaction. \n\nCollision theory also has certain drawbacks as it considers atoms/ molecules to be hard spheres and ignores their structural aspect.

The rate of a reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration of reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time. It can be expressed as instantaneous rate at a particular instant of time and average rate over a large interval of time. A number of factors such as temperature, concentration of reactants, catalyst, affect the rate of a reaction. Mathematical representation of rate of a reaction is given by rate law. It has to be determined experimentally and cannot be predicted. Order of a reaction with respect to a reactant is the power of its concentration which appears in the rate law equation. The order of a reaction is the sum of all such powers of concentration of terms for different reactants. Rate constant is the proportionality factor in the rate law. Rate constant and order of a reaction can be determined from rate law or its integrated rate equation. Molecularity is defined only for an elementary reaction. Its values are limited from 1 to 3 whereas order can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or even a fraction. Molecularity and order of an elementary reaction are same. \n\nTemperature dependence of rate constants is described by Arrhenius equation $\\begin{array} { r } { \\left( k \\ = \\ A \\mathrm { e } ^ { - E \\mathrm { a } / R T } \\right) } \\end{array}$ $E _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ corresponds to the activation energy and is given by the energy difference between activated complex and the reactant molecules, and $A$ (Arrhenius factor or pre-exponential factor) corresponds to the collision frequency. The equation clearly shows that increase of temperature or lowering of $\\mathrm { E _ { a } }$ will lead to an increase in the rate of reaction and presence of a catalyst lowers the activation energy by providing an alternate path for the reaction. According to collision theory, another factor $P$ called steric factor which refers to the orientation of molecules which collide, is important and contributes to effective collisions, thus, modifying the Arrhenius equation to $k = P Z _ { \\mathrm { A B } } \\mathrm { e } ^ { - E _ { \\mathrm { a } } / R T }$ . \n\n3.1 From the rate expression for the following reactions, determine their order of reaction and the dimensions of the rate constants. \n\n(i) $3 \\mathrm { N O } ( \\mathrm { g } )  \\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ (g) Rate $\\mathbf { \\mu } = \\mathbf { \\mu } _ { k [ \\mathbf { N O } ] } 2$   \n(ii (i $\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\mathrm { ~ ) ~ H _ 2 O _ 2 ~ ( a q ) \\ + \\ 3 I ^ { - } \\ ( a q ) \\ + \\ 2 H ^ { + } \\  \\ 2 H _ { 2 } O \\ ( l ) \\ + \\ \\Gamma _ { 3 } ^ { - } \\quad R a",

The table is organized with two rows: the first row lists the time points (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 700 seconds), and the second row provides the corresponding concentrations of butyl chloride at those times (0.100, 0.0905, 0.0820, 0.0741, 0.0671, 0.0549, 0.0439, 0.0210 mol/L). The data shows a clear decreasing trend in concentration over time, indicating the consumption of the reactant as the reaction proceeds. The concentration decreases from 0.100 mol/L at 0 seconds to 0.0210 mol/L at 700 seconds, reflecting the progress of the reaction. This decline is consistent with the concept of reaction rate as the change in concentration of a reactant over time. The pattern suggests a decelerating rate of reaction, as the concentration drops more slowly at later times, which aligns with the explanation that average rate decreases over time. The table supports the surrounding content by providing empirical data to calculate average rates of reaction over different intervals, illustrating the fundamental principle that reaction rate is related to the change in concentration per unit time. It also sets the stage for understanding instantaneous rates by showing how concentration changes over discrete time intervals. The data can be used to compute average rates between intervals, demonstrating the practical application of the theoretical concepts discussed, such as the rate of disappearance of reactants and the units of reaction rate (mol L^-1 s^-1).",

The data shows a progressive decrease in butyl chloride concentration over increasing time intervals from 0 to 800 seconds, with corresponding average rates declining from 1.90 × 10^-4 mol L^-1 s^-1 at 0-50 s to 0.4 × 10^-4 mol L^-1 s^-1 at 700-800 s. This trend illustrates the typical behavior of a hydrolysis reaction where the rate slows as the reactant concentration decreases. The table supports the surrounding content by providing empirical data to calculate average reaction rates over discrete time intervals, demonstrating the concept that average rates decrease over time and cannot precisely predict instantaneous rates. It also exemplifies the calculation of rate as the negative change in reactant concentration divided by the time interval, consistent with the equations and explanations given. The data highlights the importance of smaller time intervals for approximating instantaneous rates, as the average rate changes notably across intervals. The relationship between concentration decrease and rate decline is clear, reinforcing the kinetic principles discussed, including the units of rate and the method of determining rates from concentration changes.",

Mathematically, it states that the average rate is equal to the negative change in concentration of the reactant R divided by the time interval, which is also equal to the positive change in concentration of the product P divided by the same time interval. Here, Δ[R] represents the change in molar concentration of the reactant, and Δ[P] represents the change in molar concentration of the product, both measured in units such as mol·L⁻¹. The negative sign before Δ[R] accounts for the fact that the concentration of reactants decreases over time, ensuring the rate remains a positive quantity. The division by Δt (change in time) converts the concentration change into a rate, with units typically mol·L⁻¹·s⁻¹ or atm·s⁻¹ for gaseous reactions. This equation is foundational in chemical kinetics, providing a quantitative measure of how fast reactants are consumed and products are formed. It relates directly to the concept of instantaneous rate when Δt approaches zero, linking average and instantaneous rates through calculus. The equation also underpins the stoichiometric relationships in reactions, where rates of consumption and formation are proportional to their coefficients. Practically, it is used to analyze experimental concentration data over time intervals to determine reaction rates, essential for understanding reaction mechanisms, designing reactors, and controlling industrial chemical processes. Within the broader framework, this equation bridges empirical observations of concentration changes with theoretical kinetic models, enabling prediction and manipulation of reaction behavior.",

Mathematically, it is expressed as the negative derivative of the reactant concentration [R] with respect to time t, which equals the positive derivative of the product concentration [P] with respect to time. Here, [R] and [P] denote the molar concentrations of the reactants and products, respectively, as functions of time. The negative sign before d[R]/dt accounts for the fact that reactant concentration decreases over time, ensuring the rate is a positive quantity. The derivatives d[R]/dt and d[P]/dt represent the instantaneous rates of change of concentrations, capturing the reaction kinetics at a precise moment rather than over an interval. This equation employs differential calculus to transition from average rates (change over finite intervals) to instantaneous rates (limit as the time interval approaches zero). The context is chemical kinetics, where understanding how fast reactants are consumed and products formed is crucial. Physically, this equation quantifies the speed of the reaction at any instant, which is fundamental for modeling reaction mechanisms and designing chemical processes. It relates to other concepts such as average rate, stoichiometric coefficients, and graphical determination of rates via tangents to concentration-time curves. Practically, it is used to analyze experimental data, determine reaction orders, and optimize reaction conditions in both laboratory and industrial settings.

The vertical axis is labeled with concentration units in mol L^-1, ranging approximately from 0.0 to 0.06 mol L^-1. The horizontal axis is labeled with time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 1000 seconds.

The slope of this tangent line represents the instantaneous rate of decrease in concentration of butyl chloride. The graph uses a clean, scientific style with black lines on a white background, clear axis labels, and a precise curve. The image visually supports the surrounding text's explanation of calculating instantaneous reaction rates by drawing tangents to concentration vs. time curves.

Mathematically, the instantaneous rate r_inst is defined as the negative of the derivative of concentration with respect to time, approximated here by the difference quotient (Δ[Reactant]/Δt) over a small time interval (800 s - 400 s). The negative sign indicates the rate of disappearance of the reactant. Variables include concentration values (0.0165 and 0.037 mol L^-1) measured at two time points, and the time interval in seconds. The units mol L^-1 s^-1 denote molar concentration change per second. This calculation uses the concept of limits from calculus, where the average rate over a small interval approaches the instantaneous rate as the interval shrinks. The equation is fundamental in chemical kinetics, linking concentration changes to reaction rates, and is used to analyze reaction progress and mechanism.

The initial value, 6.79 × 10^-4 mol L^-1 min^-1, represents the rate of change of concentration of a reactant or product per minute. Multiplying by 60 min/h converts this rate to an hourly basis, yielding 4.07 × 10^-4 mol L^-1 h^-1. Similarly, converting minutes to seconds by dividing by 60 s/min results in 1.13 × 10^-5 mol L^-1 s^-1. Variables include concentration units (mol L^-1) and time units (min, h, s). The operations involve multiplication and division for unit conversion. This calculation is crucial in chemical kinetics for expressing reaction rates in different time units, facilitating comparison and interpretation of reaction speeds. It relates to the broader discussion on determining reaction rates graphically and mathematically, emphasizing the importance of consistent units in rate expressions and their practical application in experimental kinetics studies.",

Mathematically, the rate is given as one-fourth of the rate of change of NO2 concentration with respect to time, expressed as \\( \\text{Rate} = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{\\Delta[\\mathrm{NO_2}]}{\\Delta t} \\). Here, \\( \\Delta[\\mathrm{NO_2}] \\) denotes the change in molar concentration of NO2 (mol L^{-1}), and \\( \\Delta t \\) is the time interval in minutes.

The table is organized into four columns: Experiment number, Initial concentration of NO, Initial concentration of O2, and Initial rate of formation of NO2. Four experiments are listed with varying concentrations of NO and O2. Key data points show that when the concentration of NO is doubled from 0.30 to 0.60 mol L^-1 while keeping O2 constant at 0.30 mol L^-1, the rate increases from 0.096 to 0.384 mol L^-1 s^-1, a fourfold increase. Similarly, doubling O2 concentration from 0.30 to 0.60 mol L^-1 at constant NO (0.30 mol L^-1) doubles the rate from 0.096 to 0.192 mol L^-1 s^-1. When both NO and O2 concentrations are doubled, the rate quadruples to 0.768 mol L^-1 s^-1. These patterns indicate that the rate of NO2 formation depends on the square of the NO concentration and linearly on the O2 concentration, consistent with the rate law Rate = k[NO]^2[O2]^1. This supports the surrounding content's explanation of rate laws and reaction orders, illustrating experimentally how reaction rates depend on reactant concentrations and how exponents in the rate law relate to these dependencies. The table concretely demonstrates the principles of rate expression and order of reaction discussed in the text, reinforcing the concept that rate laws must be determined experimentally rather than inferred solely from stoichiometry.",

Mathematically, it expresses the instantaneous rate of decrease in the concentration of reactant R with respect to time t. Here, [R] denotes the molar concentration of reactant R, and the negative sign indicates consumption of R over time. The rate constant k is a proportionality constant characteristic of the reaction at a given temperature. The concentrations of NO and O2 are raised to powers 2 and 1 respectively, indicating the reaction order with respect to each reactant: second order in NO and first order in O2. The overall reaction order is the sum of these exponents, i.e., 3. This rate law is experimentally determined and may not correspond directly to the stoichiometric coefficients of the balanced chemical equation. The equation employs differentiation to relate concentration change over time and power functions to model the dependence of rate on reactant concentrations. It is fundamental in chemical kinetics, providing insight into reaction mechanisms and enabling calculation of reaction rates under varying concentrations. This equation exemplifies how rate laws quantify the sensitivity of reaction rates to reactant concentrations, facilitating prediction and control in chemical processes. It also connects to broader concepts such as reaction order, rate constants, and experimental determination of kinetic parameters, which are essential for understanding and modeling complex reaction mechanisms.",

It categorizes reactions by their order—zero, first, and second—and lists the corresponding units of the rate constant k for each order. The 'Order' column is left blank, implying the order is indicated by the reaction type in the first column. The units are given in terms of molarity (mol L^-1) and time (seconds), but the text in the units column appears corrupted or misformatted, showing inconsistent characters and symbols. Despite this, the intended units can be inferred from the surrounding context: zero order reactions have units of mol L^-1 s^-1, first order reactions have units of s^-1, and second order reactions have units of L mol^-1 s^-1. This aligns with the theoretical explanation that the units of the rate constant depend on the overall order of the reaction, as the rate constant compensates for the concentration terms in the rate law to yield a rate with units of concentration per time. The table supports the surrounding content by providing a quick reference for identifying reaction order from the units of the rate constant, which is crucial for interpreting experimental rate laws and understanding reaction kinetics. It illustrates the concept that the order of a reaction cannot be deduced solely from the balanced chemical equation but must be experimentally determined, as emphasized in the text. The table also complements the examples given where rate constants with specific units are used to identify reaction order, reinforcing the practical application of these units in chemical kinetics analysis.",

Mathematically, this equation expresses the concentration \\([\\mathrm{R}]\\) of a reactant at time \\(t\\) as a linear function of time, where \\([\\mathrm{R}]_0\\) is the initial concentration at \\(t=0\\), and \\(k\\) is the zero order rate constant with units of concentration per unit time. The negative slope \\(-k\\) indicates the reactant concentration decreases linearly over time. The variable \\([\\mathrm{R}]\\) denotes the concentration of the reactant species \\(R\\), \\(t\\) is time, and \\(k\\) is the rate constant characteristic of the reaction conditions. The equation is derived by integrating the differential rate law \\(\\frac{d[R]}{dt} = -k\\), which states that the rate of change of concentration is constant and independent of \\([R]\\). This linear relationship contrasts with first and higher order kinetics where concentration decays exponentially or by other nonlinear functions. The application domain is chemical kinetics, specifically zero order reactions which are rare and typically occur under conditions such as surface catalysis or enzyme saturation. Physically, this equation models scenarios where the reaction rate is limited by factors other than reactant concentration, such as catalyst surface saturation. The equation relates to broader kinetic concepts by illustrating how reaction order influences the mathematical form of integrated rate laws and experimental data analysis. Practically, it allows determination of the rate constant \\(k\\) from concentration versus time plots, facilitating understanding of reaction mechanisms and design of chemical processes. Within the broader framework, this equation exemplifies how integrated rate laws provide direct links between measurable concentrations and kinetic parameters, enabling experimental verification of reaction order and mechanistic hypotheses.",

Here, 'Rate' denotes the reaction rate, 'k' is the first order rate constant with units of reciprocal time (e.g., s^-1), and [C2H4] is the molar concentration of ethene, the reactant. Mathematically, this is a linear relationship indicating that doubling the concentration of ethene doubles the reaction rate. The equation employs multiplication as the primary operation, reflecting proportionality. This rate law is fundamental in chemical kinetics, describing how reaction velocity depends on reactant concentration. It is derived from the differential rate equation d[C2H4]/dt = -k[C2H4], integrated to yield an exponential decay of concentration over time. The equation is significant in contexts such as gas phase reactions and catalytic processes, exemplified by the hydrogenation of ethene. It connects to broader kinetic models, including zero and higher order reactions, and is essential for determining reaction mechanisms and calculating rate constants experimentally. Practically, it aids in predicting reaction behavior, optimizing industrial chemical processes, and understanding natural phenomena like radioactive decay that follow first order kinetics. Within the broader discussion, this equation exemplifies the first order kinetics framework, contrasting with zero order kinetics and providing a basis for graphical analysis (e.g., plotting ln[C2H4] vs. time to obtain a straight line with slope -k).",

Mathematically, it expresses the conservation of nucleon number and atomic number during the decay: the sum of the mass numbers (226 = 222 + 4) and atomic numbers (88 = 86 + 2) on both sides are equal, reflecting the fundamental principle of conservation in nuclear reactions. Variables include the isotopes with their respective mass (superscript) and atomic (subscript) numbers. The equation uses standard nuclear notation and represents a first-order radioactive decay process, consistent with the surrounding context discussing first-order kinetics and decay rate equations. This decay is a classic example of a first-order reaction where the rate depends linearly on the concentration of the radioactive isotope. The physical significance lies in modeling the decrease of radioactive nuclei over time, which is fundamental in nuclear chemistry, radiometric dating, and nuclear medicine. The equation relates to the broader discussion of first-order kinetics by providing a concrete example of a natural process governed by such kinetics, linking nuclear transformations to the integrated rate laws and concentration-time relationships previously analyzed. Practical applications include calculating decay constants, half-lives, and understanding the behavior of radioactive substances in various scientific and industrial contexts.",

The equation p_t = (p_i - x) + x + x = p_i + x shows that the total pressure increases by x atm due to the formation of products B and C, each contributing x atm. The variable x is also defined as the difference between total pressure at time t and initial pressure, x = p_t - p_i. This formulation uses the principle of partial pressures and stoichiometric relationships in gas reactions, where the decrease in reactant pressure equals the increase in product pressures. The equation involves basic algebraic addition and subtraction of pressures, reflecting conservation of moles and ideal gas behavior under constant volume and temperature. In the context of first order kinetics, this pressure-based approach allows determination of reaction progress and rate constants from pressure measurements rather than concentration. It connects to integrated rate laws and half-life concepts by providing a measurable physical quantity (pressure) that changes predictably over time. This equation is significant in chemical kinetics and reaction engineering, especially for gas-phase reactions where direct concentration measurements are challenging. It facilitates practical calculation of kinetic parameters and understanding of reaction mechanisms in experimental setups. Overall, it integrates stoichiometry, gas laws, and kinetics into a coherent framework for analyzing first order gas reactions.",

This equation is applied in the context of gas-phase kinetics, specifically the thermal decomposition of N2O5, where pressure changes serve as proxies for concentration changes under constant volume. Physically, the rate constant k characterizes the speed of the reaction, with units s^-1 indicating first-order kinetics. The equation links experimental pressure data to kinetic parameters, enabling determination of reaction rates from measurable quantities. It relates to other concepts such as half-life, which for first-order reactions is independent of initial concentration and can be derived from k. Practically, this equation facilitates kinetic analysis in chemical reaction engineering, atmospheric chemistry, and related fields where gas-phase reactions are studied. Within the broader framework, it exemplifies the use of integrated rate laws to extract kinetic constants from time-dependent concentration or pressure data, underpinning quantitative reaction kinetics.",

The equation k = (2.303 / t) * log([R]_0 / [R]) expresses the rate constant in terms of the initial concentration [R]_0, the concentration at time t, [R], and the elapsed time t. The logarithm is base 10, reflecting the common logarithm used in kinetics. The second form substitutes [R] = [R]_0 - 0.999[R]_0, corresponding to 99.9% completion of the reaction, simplifying the ratio inside the log to 10^3. This leads to t = 6.909 / k, showing that the time to reach 99.9% completion is approximately 10 times the half-life (t_1/2 = 0.693 / k) of the reaction. Variables: k is the first order rate constant (s^-1), t is the time elapsed (s), [R]_0 is the initial reactant concentration, and [R] is the concentration at time t. The equation uses logarithmic functions and algebraic manipulation to relate concentration changes to reaction kinetics. This is fundamental in chemical kinetics for determining reaction rates and understanding reaction progress. It connects to the concept of half-life and demonstrates the exponential decay characteristic of first order reactions. Practically, it allows chemists to predict reaction times for near-complete conversion and to calculate rate constants from experimental data. Within the broader framework, it exemplifies the mathematical treatment of reaction kinetics and supports the analysis of reaction order and rate laws.",

This expression arises from integrating the first-order rate law, which states that the concentration of a reactant decreases exponentially over time. The constant 0.693 is the natural logarithm of 2 (ln 2), reflecting the time required for the reactant concentration to reduce to half its initial value. The second part, (t / t_{1/2}) = (6.909 / k) * (k / 0.693) = 10, demonstrates that the time t required for 99.9% completion of the reaction is ten times the half-life. This follows from the integrated rate law by setting the remaining concentration to 0.1% of the initial concentration and solving for t, yielding t = (ln 1000) / k ≈ 6.909 / k. Dividing by t_{1/2} gives t / t_{1/2} = (6.909 / k) / (0.693 / k) = 10, confirming the proportionality. Variables include t_{1/2} (half-life), k (rate constant), and t (time for near-completion). The equation employs logarithmic functions and ratio operations. The context is chemical kinetics, specifically first-order reaction kinetics, where the half-life is independent of initial concentration. This relationship is fundamental in reaction rate analysis, allowing determination of reaction completion times and rate constants from experimental data. It connects to broader concepts such as integrated rate laws and reaction order, and is practically applied in fields like pharmacokinetics, environmental chemistry, and chemical engineering to predict reactant decay and design reaction processes.",

It compares zero order and first order reactions, summarizing their kinetic equations and graphical representations. For zero order reactions (R → P), the differential rate law is d[R]/dt = -k, and the integrated rate law is kt = [R]0 - [R], indicating a linear decrease of reactant concentration with time. The straight line plot is [R] vs t, and the half-life is given by [R]0/(2k), showing half-life depends on initial concentration. The units of k are concentration·time⁻¹ (mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹). For first order reactions (R → P), the differential rate law is d[R]/dt = -k[R], and the integrated rate law is [R] = [R]0 e^(-kt) or kt = ln([R]0/[R]), indicating exponential decay. The straight line plot is ln[R] vs t, and the half-life is ln2/k, which is constant and independent of initial concentration. The units of k are time⁻¹ (s⁻¹). Key patterns include the direct proportionality of half-life to initial concentration in zero order reactions versus the constant half-life in first order reactions, supporting the textual explanation that zero order half-life depends on [R]0 while first order half-life does not. The table also clarifies the graphical methods to determine rate constants and half-lives, reinforcing the concepts discussed on pages 15-17 about reaction kinetics, half-life calculations, and pseudo first order reactions. This tabular summary provides a concise reference for understanding and distinguishing zero and first order kinetics, essential for interpreting reaction rates and designing experiments.",

Mathematically, it is a chemical stoichiometric equation showing reactants and products with their molar quantities at initial time (t=0) and at completion time (t). The variables include the molar amounts of each species: initially 0.01 mol of ethyl acetate and 10 mol of water, with zero products; at completion, ethyl acetate is fully consumed (0 mol), water slightly reduced to 9.99 mol, and products formed at 0.01 mol each. The reaction is treated as pseudo first order because water is in large excess, so its concentration remains effectively constant, simplifying the kinetics to depend primarily on ethyl acetate concentration. This allows the use of first order integrated rate laws and half-life concepts discussed in the surrounding context. The equation exemplifies how reaction order can be effectively reduced under certain conditions, linking chemical kinetics theory with practical experimental setups. It also illustrates the application of integrated rate laws to real chemical systems, emphasizing the importance of initial concentrations and reaction conditions in determining reaction order and kinetics. The stoichiometric balance and molar changes provide a quantitative basis for calculating rate constants, half-lives, and reaction completion times, which are central to chemical kinetics and reaction engineering.",

Mathematically, it is a balanced chemical equation indicating stoichiometric coefficients: one molecule of H₂ reacts with one molecule of I₂ to produce two molecules of HI. Variables here are chemical species denoted by their molecular formulas and physical states (g for gas). The equation itself is not a mathematical function but a symbolic representation of reactants and products in a chemical process. Within the surrounding context, this reaction exemplifies the concept of activation energy and the Arrhenius equation, illustrating how molecular collisions and energy barriers govern reaction rates. The reaction proceeds via an activated complex, requiring sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the activation energy (E_a). This equation is foundational in chemical kinetics, serving as a model to explain temperature dependence of reaction rates, pseudo first order kinetics when one reactant is in excess, and the statistical distribution of molecular energies (Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution). It connects to broader discussions on reaction order, rate constants, and temperature effects on reaction speed. Practically, understanding this reaction aids in studying reaction mechanisms, calculating rate constants, and designing experiments to measure activation energies. It also serves as a pedagogical example in physical chemistry to link microscopic molecular behavior with macroscopic reaction rates.",

It depicts a straight line graph with the natural logarithm of the rate constant (ln k) on the vertical y-axis and the reciprocal of temperature (1/T) on the horizontal x-axis. The y-axis is labeled 'ln k' and the x-axis is labeled '1/T (K^-1)', indicating the inverse temperature in Kelvin. The graph shows a downward sloping straight line, illustrating a negative linear relationship between ln k and 1/T. The slope of the line is marked as '-Ea/R', where Ea is the activation energy and R is the gas constant, consistent with the Arrhenius equation. The y-intercept is labeled as 'ln A', where A is the Arrhenius or pre-exponential factor. The line passes through plotted data points, which are marked as small dots or circles along the line, indicating experimental or calculated values of ln k at different temperatures. The background is plain white, and the graph uses black lines and text for clarity. The visual style is clean and scientific, typical of textbook figures. This graph visually represents the linearized form of the Arrhenius equation, showing how the rate constant varies exponentially with temperature. It relates directly to the surrounding text explaining the Arrhenius equation, activation energy, and how plotting ln k versus 1/T yields a straight line from which activation energy and frequency factor can be determined. The graph supports the explanation of calculating Ea and A from experimental rate constants at different temperatures, as discussed in the adjacent content.",

The subsequent calculations demonstrate how to solve for \\(E_a\\) using experimental rate constants and temperatures, and then determine \\(A\\) by substituting back into the Arrhenius equation. This equation is fundamental in chemical kinetics for quantifying the temperature dependence of reaction rates, providing insight into the energy barrier that must be overcome for a reaction to proceed. It relates to the broader discussion on how temperature influences molecular collisions and reaction rates, and how catalysts lower \\(E_a\\) to accelerate reactions without altering equilibrium. The equation also connects to the graphical method of plotting \\(\\ln k\\) versus \\(1/T\\) to obtain a straight line whose slope is \\(-E_a/R\\), facilitating experimental determination of kinetic parameters. Practical applications include reaction rate prediction, catalyst design, and understanding reaction mechanisms in physical chemistry and chemical engineering.",

Mathematically, it is a chemical reaction equation rather than a numerical or algebraic equation, describing the stoichiometric transformation of reactants to products. The variables are chemical species: C2H5I(g) is the reactant molecule, and C2H4(g) and HI(g) are the product molecules, all in the gas phase as indicated by (g). The reaction is first order with respect to ethyl iodide, as implied by the surrounding context discussing rate constants and activation energy. The equation is central to kinetic studies where the Arrhenius equation is applied to determine the rate constant k at different temperatures, reflecting how temperature influences the reaction rate via activation energy (Ea) and frequency factor (A). The physical significance lies in understanding the decomposition mechanism and quantifying the energy barrier for bond cleavage in ethyl iodide. This reaction exemplifies the application of Arrhenius kinetics and collision theory in chemical kinetics, linking molecular energy distributions to macroscopic reaction rates. Practically, it is used to calculate rate constants at various temperatures, predict reaction behavior, and design catalytic processes to optimize reaction rates. Within the broader framework, this reaction serves as a case study illustrating the effect of temperature and catalysts on reaction kinetics, demonstrating the theoretical principles of activation energy, rate constants, and reaction mechanisms.",

Mathematically, it expresses the difference in the base-10 logarithms of the rate constants k2 and k1 as proportional to the activation energy Ea divided by the product of the gas constant R and a factor 2.303 (which converts natural logarithm to base-10 logarithm), multiplied by the difference of the reciprocals of the temperatures (1/T1 - 1/T2). Variables include k1 and k2, the rate constants at temperatures T1 and T2 respectively; Ea, the activation energy required for the reaction; R, the universal gas constant; and T1, T2, the absolute temperatures in Kelvin. The equation arises from taking the logarithm of the Arrhenius equation and subtracting the expressions at two temperatures, thereby eliminating the pre-exponential factor A, which is constant for a given reaction. This linear relationship is fundamental in chemical kinetics for determining activation energy experimentally by measuring rate constants at different temperatures. It also illustrates how increasing temperature exponentially increases the reaction rate by increasing the fraction of molecules with sufficient energy to overcome the activation barrier. The equation is central to understanding temperature dependence of reaction rates, catalyst effects (which lower Ea), and is related to the collision theory and transition state theory in physical chemistry. Practically, it is used to calculate unknown rate constants, activation energies, and to predict reaction behavior under varying thermal conditions, thus playing a crucial role in reaction engineering, catalysis, and thermally activated processes. Within the broader framework, this equation connects thermodynamic parameters with kinetic observables, enabling quantitative analysis of reaction mechanisms and the influence of temperature on chemical reactivity.",

The first curve, representing the uncatalyzed reaction, is a smooth, single-peaked curve with a higher peak indicating a larger activation energy barrier. The second curve, representing the catalyzed reaction, is also a single-peaked curve but with a noticeably lower peak, demonstrating a reduced activation energy. Both curves start at the same reactant energy level and end at the same product energy level, indicating that the catalyst does not alter the overall energy change of the reaction. The graph uses distinct colors or line styles to differentiate between the catalyzed and uncatalyzed pathways, typically with the catalyzed curve shown in a contrasting color such as red or blue. The diagram visually supports the surrounding text's explanation that a catalyst provides an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, thereby increasing the reaction rate without changing the Gibbs free energy or equilibrium constant.

Mathematically, this is a stoichiometric equation showing the molar ratios: 2 moles of KClO3 decompose to yield 2 moles of KCl and 3 moles of O2. The equation exemplifies the role of catalysts in lowering activation energy, thereby increasing reaction rate without altering the equilibrium or Gibbs free energy.

Mathematically, it signifies the transformation of reactants into products through a chemical process. The variables A and B denote distinct reactant molecules or atoms involved in the reaction. The arrow indicates the direction of the reaction from reactants to products, implying a chemical change. This equation is foundational in chemical kinetics, serving as the basis for rate expressions and mechanistic studies. In the surrounding context, it relates to collision theory and the effect of catalysts on reaction rates. The reaction rate depends on the frequency and effectiveness of collisions between A and B, influenced by factors such as activation energy (\\( E_a \\)), temperature (T), and steric factors (P). The equation is a simplified representation used to derive rate laws and understand how catalysts lower activation energy to accelerate reactions without altering equilibrium. It connects to the Arrhenius equation and collision theory by providing the fundamental reaction scheme upon which these kinetic models are built. Practically, this equation underpins the study of reaction mechanisms, catalyst design, and optimization of reaction conditions in chemical engineering and physical chemistry. It frames the broader discussion on how molecular interactions and energy barriers govern reaction kinetics and how catalysts modify these parameters to enhance reaction rates.",

The composition is divided into two main parts, each showing pairs of molecules represented by simplified structural formulas or shapes. On the left side, the diagram illustrates molecules with proper orientation, where the reactant molecules are aligned in a way that facilitates bond formation. This is visually indicated by the proximity and alignment of reactive sites on the molecules, suggesting an effective collision leading to product formation. On the right side, the diagram shows molecules with improper orientation, where the reactant molecules are misaligned or oriented such that they do not interact effectively, resulting in no reaction or the molecules simply bouncing off each other. The molecules are depicted in contrasting colors to differentiate between the two scenarios, typically using distinct hues such as blue and red or green and yellow to highlight the difference in orientation. The background is plain, focusing attention on the molecular structures and their relative positions. The visual style is schematic and educational, using clear lines and labels to emphasize the concept rather than realistic molecular depictions. This image directly relates to the surrounding text on page 21, which discusses the importance of molecular orientation in effective collisions and reaction rates, reinforcing the explanation of the steric factor (P*) in collision theory. The diagram serves as a visual aid to understand how proper molecular alignment is crucial for the formation of products in chemical reactions, complementing the theoretical discussion of catalysts and activation energy.",

Mathematically, it expresses the reaction rate as proportional to the partial pressure of dimethyl ether raised to the power 3/2, indicating a fractional reaction order of 1.5 with respect to the reactant. Here, 'Rate' denotes the reaction rate typically measured as change in concentration or pressure per unit time, 'k' is the rate constant with units dependent on the order and measurement system, and p_{CH3OCH3} is the partial pressure of dimethyl ether in bar. The exponent 3/2 signifies a non-integer order, reflecting complex reaction kinetics possibly involving multiple steps or intermediates. The rate constant k encapsulates factors such as temperature and catalyst presence, consistent with Arrhenius behavior discussed in the context. This equation is situated within chemical kinetics, specifically addressing how pressure influences reaction rates in gas-phase or closed vessel systems. It highlights the quantitative relationship between reactant concentration (expressed as partial pressure) and reaction velocity, essential for predicting reaction behavior and designing chemical processes. The fractional order relates to the molecularity and mechanism of the reaction, connecting to broader concepts like rate laws, activation energy, and temperature dependence.

The table is organized with the first row indicating time points (0, 30, 60, 90 seconds) and the second row showing corresponding concentrations of A (0.55, 0.31, 0.17, 0.085 mol L^-1). This data reflects the decrease in reactant concentration over time, illustrating the reaction progress. The pattern shows a rapid decline in [A], suggesting a significant consumption of reactant within 90 seconds. The concentration approximately halves every 30 seconds, indicating a possible first-order reaction kinetics, consistent with the surrounding context discussing rate laws and reaction orders. The data supports the concept of reaction rate dependence on reactant concentration and time, and can be used to calculate the rate constant and average rate of reaction as posed in question 3.8. The table exemplifies the practical application of kinetic principles, such as the determination of reaction order and rate constants from experimental concentration-time data.",

The first row lists the time points, while the second row provides the corresponding concentrations of N2O5.

This trend is consistent with a first-order reaction, as suggested by the surrounding context discussing rate laws and half-life calculations for N2O5 decomposition. The concentration decreases approximately exponentially, supporting the first-order kinetics assumption. The table supports the surrounding content by providing empirical data necessary for plotting concentration vs. time and log concentration vs. time graphs, determining the rate constant k, and calculating the half-life of the reaction.

The variables are chemical species: SO2Cl2 (reactant), SO2 and Cl2 (products), all in gaseous state as indicated by (g). The equation itself is not a rate law but the basis for kinetic analysis in the surrounding context, where the rate of reaction, rate constant, and order are studied. The reaction is relevant in chemical kinetics, where the rate of decomposition and its dependence on concentration and temperature are analyzed. This reaction is often studied to determine the rate law, rate constant (k), and half-life, which are fundamental in understanding reaction mechanisms and energy profiles. It relates to other concepts such as first-order kinetics, Arrhenius equation, and activation energy discussed in the context.

The first row of data shows an initial condition at time 0 seconds with a total pressure of 0.5 atm, and the second row shows data at 100 seconds with a total pressure of 0.6 atm. This indicates an increase in pressure over time, suggesting the progression of the reaction or formation of gaseous products. The small dataset implies a preliminary or simplified measurement to observe pressure changes as a function of time. Given the surrounding context of reaction kinetics and rate laws, this table likely supports the analysis of reaction rate by correlating pressure changes with time, which can be used to determine the rate constant or order of reaction. The increase in pressure from 0.5 atm to 0.6 atm over 100 seconds suggests a reaction producing gaseous species or changing the number of moles of gas, which is consistent with kinetic studies of gas-phase reactions such as the decomposition of N2O5 mentioned in the context.

The second row provides the corresponding rate constants multiplied by 10^5 (105 × k/s⁻¹) at each temperature: 0.0787, 1.70, 25.7, 178, and 2140 respectively. This structure allows for direct comparison of how the rate constant changes with temperature. The data shows a clear exponential increase in the rate constant as temperature rises, consistent with the Arrhenius equation, which relates temperature to reaction rate. Specifically, the rate constant increases from 7.87 × 10⁻⁷ s⁻¹ at 0°C to 2.14 × 10⁻² s⁻¹ at 80°C, indicating a strong temperature dependence. This trend supports the concept that higher temperatures increase molecular collisions and energy, thus accelerating reaction rates. The table is significant in the context of the surrounding content, which discusses reaction kinetics, rate laws, and temperature effects on rate constants. It provides empirical data to illustrate the theoretical principles of temperature dependence of reaction rates and can be used to calculate activation energy and pre-exponential factors by plotting ln(k) versus 1/T.

The inner transition elements such as $T h S P a$ and $y$ are proving excellent sources of nuclear energy in modern times. \n\nThe $d$ -block of the periodic table contains the elements of the groups 3-12 in which the $d$ orbitals are progressively filled in each of the four long periods. The $f -$ block consists of elements in which 4 $f$ and 5 $f$ orbitals are progressively filled. They are placed in a separate panel at the bottom of the periodic table. The names transition metals and inner transition metals are often used to refer to the elements of $d \\cdot$ -and $f$ blocks respectively. \n\nThere are mainly four series of the transition metals, $3 d$ series (Sc to Zn), $4 d$ series (Y to Cd), $5 d$ series (La and Hf to Hg) and $6 d$ series which has Ac and elements from Rf to Cn. The two series of the inner transition metals; $4 f$ (Ce to Lu) and $5 f$ (Th to Lr) are known as lanthanoids and actinoids respectively. \n\nOriginally the name transition metals was derived from the fact that their chemical properties were transitional between those of $s$ and $p { \\cdot }$ -block elements. Now according to IUPAC, transition metals are defined as metals which have incomplete $d$ subshell either in neutral atom or in their ions. Zinc, cadmium and mercury of group 12 have full $d ^ { 1 0 }$ configuration in their ground state as well as in their common oxidation states and hence, are not regarded as transition metals. However, being the end members of the $3 d .$ , $4 d$ and $5 d$ transition series, respectively, their chemistry is studied along with the chemistry of the transition metals. \n\nThe presence of partly filled $d$ or $f$ orbitals in their atoms makes transition elements different from that of the non-transition elements. Hence, transition elements and their compounds are studied separately. However, the usual theory of valence as applicable to the nontransition elements can be applied successfully to the transition elements also. \n\nVarious precious metals such as silver, gold and platinum and industrially important metals like iron, copper and titanium belong to the transition metals series. \n\nIn this Unit, we shall first deal with the electronic configuration, occurrence and general characteristics of transition elements with special emphasis on the trends in the properties of the first row $( 3 d )$ transition metals along with the preparation and properties of some important compounds. This will be followed by consideration of certain general aspects such as electronic configurations, oxidation states and chemical reactivity of the inner transition metals",

This will be followed by consideration of certain general aspects such as electronic configurations, oxidation states and chemical reactivity of the inner transition metals. \n\nTHE TRANSITION ELEMENTS (d-BLOCK) \n\nThe $d$ -block occupies the large middle section of the periodic table flanked between $s -$ and $p -$ blocks in the periodic table. The $d$ -orbitals of the penultimate energy level of atoms receive electrons giving rise to four rows of the transition metals, i.e., 3d, $4 d$ ,id $5 d$ and $6 d .$ All these series of transition elements are shown in Table 4.1. \n\nIn general the electronic configuration of outer orbitals of these elements iS $\\overline { { { \\bf n } } } - 1 ) d ^ { 1 - 1 0 } { \\bf n } s ^ { 1 - 2 }$ e f selct c $4 d ^ { 1 0 } 5 s ^ { 0 }$ The (n–l) stands for the inner $d$ orbitals which may have one to ten electrons and the outermost ns orbital may have one or two electrons. However, this generalisation has several exceptions because of very little energy difference between $( \\mathrm { n - 1 } ) d$ and ns orbitals. Furthermore, half and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A consequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations of Cr and Cu in the $3 d$ series. For example, consider the case of Cr, which has $3 d ^ { 5 } 4 s ^ { 1 }$ configuration instead of $3 d ^ { 4 } 4 s ^ { 2 }$ ;the energy gap between the two sets $3 d$ and 4s) of orbitals is small enough to prevent electron entering the $3 d$ orbitals. Similarly in case of Cu, the configuration is $3 d ^ { 1 0 } 4 s ^ { 1 }$ and not $3 d ^ { 9 } 4 s ^ { 2 }$ . The ground state electronic configurations of the outer orbitals of transition elements are given in Table 4.1. \n\nThe electronic configurations of outer orbitals of $Z \\mathrm { n }$ , Cd, $\\mathrm { H g }$ and Cn are represented by the general formula $( \\mathrm { n - 1 } ) d ^ { 1 0 } \\mathrm { n } s ^ { 2 }$ . The orbitals in these elements are completely filled in the ground state as well as in their common oxidation states. Therefore, they are not regarded as transition elements. \n\nThe $d$ orbitals of the transition elements protrude to the periphery of an atom more than the other orbitals (i.e., s and $p )$ , hence, they are more influenced by the surroundings as well as affect the atoms or molecules surrounding them. In some respects, ions of a given $d ^ { \\mathrm { n } }$ configuration $( { \\bf n } = 1 - 9 )$ have similar magnetic and electronic properties. With partly filled $d$ orbitals these elements exhibit certain characteristic properties such as display of a variety of oxidation states, formation of coloured ions and entering into complex formation with a variety of ligands. \n\nThe transition metals and their compounds also exhibit catalytic property and paramagnetic",

All these characteristics have been discussed in detail later in this Unit. \n\nThere are greater similarities in the properties of the transition elements of a horizontal row in contrast to the non-transition elements. However, some group similarities also exist. We shall first study the general characteristics and their trends in the horizontal rows (particularly $3 d$ row) and then consider some group similarities. \n\nIntext Question \n\n4.1 Silver atom has completely filled $d$ orbitals $( 4 d ^ { 1 0 } )$ in its ground state. How can you say that it is a transition element? \n\nWe will discuss the properties of elements of first transition series only in the following sections. \n\n4.3 Seneral Properties of the Transition Elements (d-Block) \n\n4.3.1 Physical Properties \n\nNearly all the transition elements display typical metallic properties such as high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, high thermal and electrical conductivity and metallic lustre. with the exceptions of Zn, Cd, Hg and Mn, they have one or more typical metallic structures at normal temperatures. - \n\nThe transition metals (with the exception of $Z \\mathrm { n }$ , Cd and Hg) are very hard and have low volatility. Their melting and boiling points are high. Fig. 4.1 depicts the melting points of transition metals belonging to $3 d$ , $4 d$ and $5 d$ series. The high melting points of these metals are attributed to the involvement of greater number of electrons from $( \\mathrm { n - 1 } ) d$ in addition to the ns electrons in the interatomic metallic bonding. In any row the melting points of these metals rise to a maximum at $d ^ { 5 }$ except for anomalous values of Mn and Tc and fall regularly as the atomic number increases. They have high enthalpies of atomisation which are shown in Fig. 4.2. The maxima at about the middle of each series indicate that one unpaired electron per $d$ orbital is particularly favourable for strong interatomic interaction. In general, greater the number of valence electrons, stronger is the resultant bonding. Since the enthalpy of atomisation is an important factor in determining the standard electrode potential of a metal, metals with very high enthalpy of atomisation (i.e., very high boiling point) tend to be noble in their reactions (see later for electrode potentials). \n\nAnother generalisation that may be drawn from Fig. 4.2 is that the metals of the second and third series have greater enthalpies of atomisation than the corresponding elements of the first series; this is an important factor in accounting for the occurrence of much more frequent metal – metal bonding in compounds of the heavy transition metals. \n\n4.3.2 Variation in Atomic and Ionic Sizes of Transition Metals \n\nIn general, ions of the same charge in a given series show progressive decrease in radius with increasing atomic number. This is because the new electron enters a $d$ orbital each time the nuclear charge increases by unity. It may be recalled that the shielding effect of a $d$ electron is not that effective, hence the net electrostatic attraction between the nuclear charge and the outermost electron increases and the ionic radius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a given series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An interesting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series",

It may be recalled that the shielding effect of a $d$ electron is not that effective, hence the net electrostatic attraction between the nuclear charge and the outermost electron increases and the ionic radius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a given series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An interesting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series are compared with those of the corresponding elements in the other series. The curves in Fig. 4.3 show an increase from the first $( 3 d )$ to the second $( 4 d )$ series of the elements but the radii of the third $( 5 d )$ series are virtually the same as those of the corresponding members of the second series. This phenomenon is associated with the intervention of the $4 f$ orbitals which must be filled before the $5 d$ series of elements begin. The filling of $4 f$ before $5 d$ orbital results in a regular decrease in atomic radii called Lanthanoid contraction which essentially compensates for the expected increase in atomic size with increasing atomic number. The net result of the lanthanoid contraction is that the second and the third $d$ series exhibit similar radii (e.g., $Z \\mathrm { r } ~ 1 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { p m }$ , Hf $1 5 9 \\mathrm { p m } )$ and have very similar physical and chemical properties much more than that expected on the basis of usual family relationship. \n\nThe factor responsible for the lanthanoid contraction is somewhat similar to that observed in an ordinary transition series and is attributed to similar cause, i.e., the imperfect shielding of one electron by another in the same set of orbitals. However, the shielding of one $4 f$ electron by another is less than that of one $d$ electron by another, and as the nuclear charge increases along the series, there is fairly regular decrease in the size of the entire $4 f ^ { \\mathrm { n } }$ orbitals. \n\nThe decrease in metallic radius coupled with increase in atomic mass results in a general increase in the density of these elements. Thus, from titanium $\\left( Z = 2 2 \\right)$ to copper $( Z \\ : = \\ : 2 9 )$ the significant increase in the density may be noted (Table 4.2). \n\nWhy do the transition elements exhibit higher enthalpies of atomisation? \n\nBecause of large number of unpaired electrons in their atoms they have stronger interatomic interaction and hence stronger bonding between atoms resulting in higher enthalpies of atomisation. \n\nIntexct Question \n\n4.2 In the series Sc $\\left( Z = 2 1 \\right)$ to $Z \\mathrm { n }$ (cid:) $\\left( Z = 3 0 \\right)$ , the enthalpy of atomisation of zinc is the lowest, i.e., $1 2 6 ~ \\mathrm { k J ~ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ . Why? \n\n4.3.3 Ionisation Enthalpies \n\nThere is an increase in ionisation enthalpy along each series of the transition elements from left to right due to an increase in nuclear charge which accompanies the filling of the inner $d$ orbitals. Table 4.2 gives the values of the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first series of transition elements. These values show that the successive enthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the case of non-transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along a series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation along a period of non-transition elements. The first ionisation enthal",

These values show that the successive enthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the case of non-transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along a series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation along a period of non-transition elements. The first ionisation enthalpy, in general, increases, but the magnitude of the increase in the second and third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements, is much higher along a series. \n\nThe irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the metals of $3 d$ series, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for by considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies of $4 s$ and $3 d$ orbitals. You have learnt that when $d$ -block elements form ions, ns electrons are lost before $( n - 1 )$ (cid:) $d$ electrons. As we move along the period in $3 d$ series, we see that nuclear charge increases from scandium to zinc but electrons are added to the orbital of inner subshell, i.e., $3 d$ orbitals. These $3 d$ electrons shield the $4 s$ electrons from the increasing nuclear charge somewhat more effectively than the outer shell electrons can shield one another. Therefore, the atomic radii decrease less rapidly. Thus, ionization energies increase only slightly along the $3 d$ series. The doubly or more highly charged ions have $d ^ { \\mathrm { n } }$ configurations with no 4s electrons. A general trend of increasing values of second ionisation enthalpy is expected as the effective nuclear charge increases because one $d$ electron does not shield another electron from the influence of nuclear charge because $d$ -orbitals differ in direction. However, the trend of steady increase in second and third ionisation enthalpy breaks for the formation of $\\mathrm { { M n ^ { 2 + } } }$ and $\\mathrm { F e ^ { 3 + } }$ respectively. In both the cases, ions have $d ^ { 5 }$ configuration. Similar breaks occur at corresponding elements in the later transition series. \n\nThe interpretation of variation in ionisation enthalpy for an electronic configuration $d ^ { n }$ is as follows: \n\nThe three terms responsible for the value of ionisation enthalpy are attraction of each electron towards nucleus, repulsion between the electrons and the exchange energy. Exchange energy is responsible for the stabilisation of energy state. Exchange energy is approximately proportional to the total number of possible pairs of parallel spins in the degenerate orbitals. when several electrons occupy a set of degenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum possible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins (Hunds rule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability increases, the ionisation becomes more difficult. There is no loss of exchange energy at $d ^ { 6 }$ configuration. $\\mathrm { { M n ^ { + } } }$ has $3 d ^ { 5 } 4 s ^ { 1 }$ configuration and configuration of $\\mathrm { { C r ^ { + } } }$ is $d ^ { 5 }$ , therefore, ionisation enthalpy of $\\mathrm { M n ^ { + } }$ is lower than $\\mathrm { { C r ^ { + } } }$ . In the same way, $\\mathrm { F e ^ { 2 + } }$ has $d ^ { 6 }$ configuration and $\\mathrm { M n ^ { 2 + } }$ has $3 d ^ { 5 }$ configuration",

In the same way, $\\mathrm { F e ^ { 2 + } }$ has $d ^ { 6 }$ configuration and $\\mathrm { M n ^ { 2 + } }$ has $3 d ^ { 5 }$ configuration. Hence, ionisation enthalpy of $\\mathrm { F e ^ { 2 + } }$ is lower than the $\\mathrm { M n ^ { 2 + } }$ . In other words, we can say that the third ionisation enthalpy of Fe is lower than that of Mn. ▲ \n\nThe lowest common oxidation state of these metals is $+ 2$ . To form the $\\mathbf { M } ^ { 2 + }$ ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and second ionisation enthalpy is required in addition to the enthalpy of atomisation. The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy which shows unusually high values for $\\mathrm { C r }$ and Cu where $\\mathbf { M } ^ { + }$ ions have the $d ^ { 5 }$ and $d ^ { 1 0 }$ configurations respectively. The value for $Z \\mathrm { n }$ is correspondingly low as the ionisation causes the removal of one $4 s$ electron which results in the formation of stable $d ^ { 1 0 }$ configuration. The trend in the third ionisation enthalpies is not complicated by the $4 s$ orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an electron from the $d ^ { 5 } \\ ( \\mathrm { M n } ^ { 2 + } )$ and $d ^ { 1 0 } ( Z \\mathrm n ^ { 2 + } )$ ions. In general, the third ionisation enthalpies are quite high. Also the high values for third ionisation enthalpies of copper, nickel and zinc indicate why it is difficult to obtain oxidation state greater than two for these elements. \n\nAlthough ionisation enthalpies give some guidance concerning the relative stabilities of oxidation states, this problem is very complex and not amenable to ready generalisation. \n\n4.3.4 Oxidation States \n\nOne of the notable features of a transition elements is the great variety of oxidation states these may show in their compounds. Table 4.3 lists the common oxidation states of the first row transition elements. \n\nThe elements which give the greatest number of oxidation states occur in or near the middle of the series. Manganese, for example, exhibits all the oxidation states from $+ 2$ to $+ 7$ . The lesser number of oxidation states at the extreme ends stems from either too few electrons to lose or share (Sc, Ti) or too many $d$ electrons (hence fewer orbitals available in which to share electrons with others) for higher valence (Cu, Zn). Thus, early in the series scandium(Il) is virtually unknown and titanium (IV) is more stable than Ti(l) or Ti(II). At the other end, the only oxidation state of zinc is $+ 2$ (no $d$ electrons are involved). The maximum oxidation states of reasonable stability correspond in value to the sum of the $s$ and $d$ electrons upto manganese $\\mathrm { \\bar { ( T i } ^ { \\mathrm { { I V } } } O _ { 2 } }$ , ${ \\mathrm { V } } ^ { \\mathrm { v } } { \\mathrm { O } } _ { 2 } ^ { + }$ , $\\mathrm { C r",

This is in contrast with the variability of oxidation states of non transition elements where oxidation states normally differ by a unit of two. \n\nAn interesting feature in the variability of oxidation states of the $d -$ block elements is noticed among the groups (groups 4 through 10). Although in the $p$ -block the lower oxidation states are favoured by the heavier members (due to inert pair effect), the opposite is true in the groups of $d$ -block. For example, in group 6, Mo(VI) and w(VI) are found to be more stable than $\\mathrm { C r ( V I ) }$ .

The low value for Sc reflects the stability of ${ \\mathrm { S c } } ^ { 3 + }$ which has a noble gas configuration. The highest value for $Z \\mathrm { n }$ is due to the removal of an electron from the stable $d ^ { 1 0 }$ configuration of $Z \\mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ .  he comparatively high value for Mn shows that $\\mathrm { \\tilde { M n } } ^ { 2 + } ( d ^ { 5 } )$ is particularly stable, whereas comparatively low value for Fe shows the extra stability of $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + } \\ : ( d ^ { 5 } )$ .

The ability of fluorine to stabilise the highest oxidation state is due to either higher lattice energy as in the case of $\\mathrm { C o F _ { 3 } }$ , or higher bond enthalpy terms for the higher covalent compounds, e.g., $\\mathrm { V F } _ { 5 }$ and $\\mathrm { C r F _ { 6 } }$ \n\nAlthough ${ \\mathrm { V } } ^ { + 5 }$ is represented only by $\\mathrm { V F } _ { 5 }$ , the other halides, however, undergo hydrolysis to give oxohalides, $\\mathrm { { V O X } _ { 3 } }$ .

Many of them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are 'noble'—that is, they are unaffected by single acids. \n\nThe metals of the first series with the exception of copper are relatively more reactive and are oxidised by $1 \\mathrm { M ~ H ^ { + } }$ ,though the actual rate at which these metals react with oxidising agents like hydrogen ion $\\mathrm { ( H ^ { + } ) }$ is sometimes slow. For example, titanium and vanadium, in practice, are passive to dilute non oxidising acids at room temperature. The $E ^ { \\scriptscriptstyle 0 }$ values for $\\mathbf { M } ^ { 2 + } / \\mathbf { M }$ (Table 4.2) indicate a decreasing tendency to form divalent cations across the series. This general trend towards less negative $E ^ { \\scriptscriptstyle 0 }$ values is related to the increase in the sum of the first and second ionisation enthalpies. It is interesting to note that the $E ^ { \\circ }$ values for Mn, Ni and $Z \\mathrm { n }$ are more negative than expected from the general trend.

Substances which are attracted very strongly are said to be ferromagnetic. In fact, ferromagnetism is an extreme form of paramagnetism. Many of the transition metal ions are paramagnetic. \n\nParamagnetism arises from the presence of unpaired electrons, each such electron having a magnetic moment associated with its spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum. For the compounds of the first series of transition metals, the contribution of the orbital angular momentum is effectively quenched and hence is of no significance. For these, the magnetic moment is determined by the number of unpaired electrons and is calculated by using the 'spin-only' formula, i.e., \n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons and  is the magnetic moment in units of Bohr magneton (BM). A single unpaired electron has a magnetic moment of 1.73 Bohr magnetons (BM). \n\nThe magnetic moment increases with the increasing number of unpaired electrons. Thus, the observed magnetic moment gives a useful indication about the number of unpaired electrons present in the atom, molecule or ion. The magnetic moments calculated from the 'spin-only' formula and those derived experimentally for some ions of the first row transition elements are given in Table 4.7.

This frequency generally lies in the visible region. The colour observed corresponds to the complementary colour \n\nof the light absorbed. The frequency of the light absorbed is determined by the nature of the ligand. In aqueous solutions where water molecules are the ligands, the colours of the ions observed are listed in Table 4.8. A few coloured solutions of $d \\cdot$ -block elements are illustrated in Fig. 4.5. \n\n4.3.11 Formation of Complex Compounds \n\nComplex compounds are those in which the metal ions bind a number of anions or neutral molecules giving complex species with characteristic properties.

This is due to the comparatively smaller sizes of the metal ions, their high ionic charges and the availability of $d$ orbitals for bond formation. \n\n4.3.12 Catalytic Properties \n\nThe transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple oxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in Contact Process), finely divided iron (in Haber's Process), and nickel (in Catalytic Hydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface involve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms of the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilise $3 d$ and $4 s$ electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening of the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowering). Also because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states, they become more effective as catalysts. For example, iron(lIl) catalyses the reaction between iodide and persulphate ions. \n\nAn explanation of this catalytic action can be given as: \n\n4.3.13 Formation of Interstitial Compounds \n\nInterstitial compounds are those which are formed when small atoms like H, C or N are trapped inside the crystal lattices of metals. They are usually non stoichiometric and are neither typically ionic nor covalent, for example, TiC, $\\mathrm { M n _ { 4 } N }$ $\\mathrm { F e _ { 3 } H }$ , $\\mathrm { V H } _ { 0 ^ { \\cdot } 5 6 }$ and $\\mathrm { T i H } _ { 1 . 7 }$ , etc. The formulas quoted do not, of course, correspond to any normal oxidation state of the metal. Because of the nature of their composition, these compounds are referred to as interstitial compounds. The principal physical and chemical characteristics of these compounds are as follows: \n\n(i) They have high melting points, higher than those of pure metals.   \n(ii) They are very hard, some borides approach diamond in hardness.   \n(ii) They retain metallic conductivity.   \n(iv) They are chemically inert. \n\n4.3.14 Alloy Formation \n\nAn alloy is a blend of metals prepared by mixing the components. Alloys may be homogeneous solid solutions in which the atoms of one metal are distributed randomly among the atoms of the other. Such alloys are formed by atoms with metallic radii that are within about 15 percent of each other. Because of similar radi and other characteristics of transition metals, alloys are readily formed by these metals. The alloys so formed are hard and have often high melting points. The best known are ferrous alloys: chromium, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum and manganese are used for the production of a variety of steels and stainless steel. Alloys of transition metals with non transition metals such as brass (copper-zinc) and bronze (copper-tin), are also of considerable industrial importance. \n\nExample 4.Q what is meant by 'disproportionation' of an oxidation state? Give an example. \n\nSolution When a particular oxidation state becomes less stable relative to other oxidation states, one lower, one higher, it is said to undergo disproportionation. For example, manganese (VIl) becomes unstable relative to manganese(VIl) and manganese (IV) in acidic solution. \n\nIntext Question \n\n4.9 Explain why $\\mathrm { C u } ^ { + }$ ion is not stable in aqueous solutions? \n\n4.4 Some Important Compounds of Transition Elements \n\n4.4.1 Oxides and Oxoanions of Metals",

All the metals except scandium form MO oxides which are ionic. The highest oxidation number in the oxides, coincides with the group number and is attained in $\\mathrm { S c } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ to $\\mathbf { M n } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 7 }$ . Beyond group 7, no higher oxides of iron above $\\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ are known. Besides the oxides, the oxocations stabilise $\\mathrm { v ^ { v } }$ as ${ \\mathrm { V O } } _ { 2 } ^ { + }$ , ${ \\mathrm { V } } ^ { \\mathrm { I V } }$ as ${ \\mathrm { V O } } ^ { 2 + }$ and $\\mathrm { T i } ^ { \\mathrm { { I V } } }$ as $\\mathrm { T i O ^ { 2 + } }$ \n\nAs the oxidation number of a metal increases, ionic character decreases. In the case of Mn, $\\bf { M n } _ { 2 } \\bf { O } _ { 7 }$ is a covalent green oil. Even $\\mathrm { C r O } _ { 3 }$ and $\\mathrm { V _ { 2 } O _ { 5 } }$ have low melting points. In these higher oxides, the acidic character is predominant. \n\nThus, $\\mathbf { M n } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 7 }$ gives $\\mathrm { H M n O _ { 4 } }$ and $\\mathrm { C r O } _ { 3 }$ gives $\\mathrm { H _ { 2 } C r O _ { 4 } }$ and $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C r } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 7 }$ . $\\mathrm { V } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 }$ is, however, amphoteric though mainly acidic and it gives $\\mathrm { V O _ { 4 } } ^ { 3 - }$ as wellas $\\mathrm { V O _ { 2 } } ^ { + }$ salts. In vanadium there is gradual change from the basic ${ \\mathrm { V } } _ { 2 } { \\mathrm { O } } _ { 3 }$ to less basic $\\mathrm { V } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ and to amphoteric $\\mathrm { V } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 }$ $\\mathrm { { V _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } } }$ dissolves in acids to give $\\mathrm { V O } ^ { 2 + }$ salts.

The well characterised $\\mathrm { C r O }$ is basic but $\\mathrm { { C r } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { { O } _ { 3 } } }$ is amphoteric. \n\nPotassium dichromate ${ \\bf K } _ { 2 } { \\bf C } r _ { 2 } { \\bf O } _ { 7 }$ \n\nPotassium dichromate is a very important chemical used in leather industry and as an oxidant for preparation of many azo compounds. Dichromates are generally prepared from chromate, which in turn are obtained by the fusion of chromite ore $\\scriptstyle \\left( \\mathrm { F e C r _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } } \\right)$ with sodium or potassium carbonate in free access of air. The reaction with sodium carbonate occurs as follows: \n\nThe yellow solution of sodium chromate is filtered and acidified with sulphuric acid to give a solution from which orange sodium dichromate, $\\mathrm { N a _ { 2 } C r _ { 2 } O _ { 7 } }$ . $2 \\mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ can be crystallised. \n\nSodium dichromate is more soluble than potassium dichromate. The latter is therefore, prepared by treating the solution of sodium dichromate with potassium chloride. \n\nOrange crystals of potassium dichromate crystallise out. The chromates and dichromates are interconvertible in aqueous solution depending upon $\\mathrm { p H }$ of the solution. The oxidation state of chromium in chromate and dichromate is the same. \n\nThe structures of chromate ion, $\\mathrm { C r O } _ { 4 } ^ { 2 - }$ and the dichromate ion, $\\mathrm { { C r } _ { 2 } { O _ { 7 } } ^ { 2 - } }$ are shown below. The chromate ion is tetrahedral whereas the dichromate ion consists of two tetrahedra sharing one corner with Cr-O-Cr bond angle of $1 2 6 ^ { \\circ }$ . \n\nSodium and potassium dichromates are strong oxidising agents; the sodium salt has a greater solubility in water and is extensively used as an oxidising agent in organic chemistry. Potassium dichromate is used as a primary standard in volumetric analysis. In acidic solution, its oxidising action can be represented as follows: \n\nThus, acidified potassium dichromate will oxidise iodides to iodine, sulphides to sulphur, tin(II) to tin(IV) and iron(II) salts to iron(II). The half-reactions are noted below: \n\nThe full ionic equation may be obtained by adding the half-reaction for potassium dichromate to the half-reaction for the reducing agent, for e.g., \n\nPotassium permanganate $\\bf K M n O _ { 4 }$ \n\nPotassium permanganate is prepared by fusion of $\\mathbf { M n O } _ { 2 }$ with an alkali metal hydroxide and an oxidising agent like $\\mathrm { K N O } _ { 3 }$ .

These can be explained by the use of molecular orbital theory which is beyond the present scope. \n\nThe manganate and permanganate ions are tetrahedral; the $\\pi$ - bonding takes place by overlap of $p$ orbitals of oxygen with $d$ orbitals of manganese. The green manganate is paramagnetic because of one unpaired electron but the permanganate is diamagnetic due to the absence of unpaired electron. \n\nAcidified permanganate solution oxidises oxalates to carbon dioxide, iron(Il) to iron(Ill), nitrites to nitrates and iodides to free iodine.

Although many reactions can be understood by consideration of redox potential, kinetics of the reaction is also an important factor.

Because lanthanum closely resembles the lanthanoids, it is usually included in any discussion of the lanthanoids for which the general symbol Ln is often used. Similarly, a discussion of the actinoids includes actinium besides the fourteen elements constituting the series. The lanthanoids resemble one another more closely than do the members of ordinary transition elements in any series. They have only one stable oxidation state and their chemistry provides an excellent opportunity to examine the effect of small changes in size and nuclear charge along a series of otherwise similar elements. The chemistry of the actinoids is, on the other hand, much more complicated. The complication arises partly owing to the occurrence of a wide range of oxidation states in these elements and partly because their radioactivity creates special problems in their study; the two series will be considered separately here. \n\nThe names, symbols, electronic configurations of atomic and some ionic states and atomic and ionic radii of lanthanum and lanthanoids (for which the general symbol Ln is used) are given in Table 4.9. \n\n4.5.1 Electronic Configurations \n\nIt may be noted that atoms of these elements have electronic configuration with $6 s ^ { 2",

However, the electronic configurations of all the tripositive ions (the most stable oxidation state of all the lanthanoids) are of the form $4 f ^ { \\mathrm { n } }$ (cid:) $( \\mathbf { n } = \\mathbf { \\bar { \\rho } } _ { 1 }$ to 14 with increasing atomic number). \n\n4.5.2 Atomic and Ionic Sizes \n\nThe overall decrease in atomic and ionic radii from lanthanum to lutetium (the lanthanoid contraction) is a unique feature in the chemistry of the lanthanoids. It has far reaching consequences in the chemistry of the third transition series of the elements. The decrease in atomic radii (derived from the structures of metals) is not quite regular as it is regular in $\\mathbf { M } ^ { 3 + }$ ions (Fig. 4.6). This contraction is, of course, similar to that observed in an ordinary transition series and is attributed to the same cause, the imperfect shielding of one electron by another in the same sub-shell. However, the shielding of one $4 f$ electron by another is less than one $d$ electron by another with the increase in nuclear charge along the series. There is fairly regular decrease in the sizes with increasing atomic number. \n\nThe cumulative effect of the contraction of the lanthanoid series, known as lanthanoid contraction, causes the radii of the members of the third transition series to be very similar to those of the corresponding members of the second series. The almost identical radii of $Z \\mathrm { r }$ $( 1 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { p m } )$ and Hf $\\left( 1 5 9 \\ \\mathrm { p m } \\right)$ , a consequence of the lanthanoid contraction, account for their occurrence together in nature and for the difficulty faced in their separation. \n\n4.5.3 Oxidation States \n\nIn the lanthanoids, La(Il) and $\\operatorname { L n } ( \\operatorname { I I I } )$ compounds are predominant species. However, occasionally $+ 2$ and $+ 4$ ions in solution or in solid compounds are also obtained. This irregularity (as in ionisation enthalpies) arises mainly from the extra stability of empty, half-filled or filled $f$ subshell. Thus, the formation of $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { \\mathrm { \\bar { \\mathrm { { I v } } } } }$ is favoured by its noble gas configuration, but it is a strong oxidant reverting to the common $+ 3$ state. The $E ^ { \\circ }$ value for $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 4 + } / \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ is $+ \\ 1 . 7 4 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ which suggests that it can oxidise water. However, the reaction rate is very slow and hence $\\mathrm { C e ( I V ) }$ is a good analytical reagent. Pr, Nd, Tb and Dy also exhibit $+ 4$ state but only in oxides, $\\mathbf { M O } _ { 2 }$",

However, the reaction rate is very slow and hence $\\mathrm { C e ( I V ) }$ is a good analytical reagent. Pr, Nd, Tb and Dy also exhibit $+ 4$ state but only in oxides, $\\mathbf { M O } _ { 2 }$ . $\\bar { \\mathrm { E } } \\mathrm { u } ^ { 2 + }$ is formed by losing the two s electrons and its $f ^ { \\bar { 7 } }$ configuration accounts for the formation of this ion.

Similarly ${ \\mathrm { Y b } } ^ { 2 + }$ which has $\\dot { \\boldsymbol { f } } ^ { \\intercal 4 }$ configuration is a reductant. $\\mathrm { T b } ^ { \\mathrm { I V } }$ has half-filled $f$ orbitals and is an oxidant. The behaviour of samarium is very much like europium, exhibiting both $+ 2$ and $+ 3$ oxidation states. \n\n4.5.4 General Characteristics \n\nAll the lanthanoids are silvery white soft metals and tarnish rapidly in air. The hardness increases with increasing atomic number, samarium being steel hard. Their melting points range between 1000 to 1200 K but samarium melts at 1623 K. They have typical metallic structure and are good conductors of heat and electricity. Density and other properties change smoothly except for Eu and Yb and occasionally for Sm and Tm. \n\nMany trivalent lanthanoid ions are coloured both in the solid state and in aqueous solutions. Colour of these ions may be attributed to the presence of $f$ electrons. Neither ${ \\mathrm { L a } } ^ { 3 + }$ nor ${ \\mathrm { L u } } ^ { 3 + }$ ion shows any colour but the rest do so. However, absorption bands are narrow, probably because of the excitation within $f$ level. The lanthanoid ions other than the $f ^ { \\circ }$ type $\\mathrm { { ( L a } ^ { 3 + } }$ and $\\mathrm { C e ^ { 4 + } } ]$ and he $f ^ { 1 4 }$ type $\\mathrm { ( Y b ) ^ { 2 + } }$ and ${ \\mathrm { L u } } ^ { 3 + }$ are all paramagnetic. \n\nThe first ionisation enthalpies of the lanthanoids are around $6 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { k J \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ , the second about $1 2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { k J \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ comparable with those of calcium. A detailed discussion of the variation of the third ionisation enthalpies indicates that the exchange enthalpy considerations (as in $3 d$ orbitals of the first transition series), appear to impart a certain degree of stability to empty, half-filled and completely filled orbitals $f$ level. This is indicated from the abnormally low value of the third ionisation enthalpy of lanthanum, gadolinium and lutetium. \n\nIn their chemical behaviour, in general, the earlier members of the series are quite reactive similar to calcium but, with increasing atomic number, they behave more like aluminium.

This is, of course, a small variation. The metals combine with hydrogen when gently heated in the gas. The carbides, $\\mathrm { L n } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ , $\\mathrm { L n } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ and $\\mathrm { L n C _ { 2 } }$ are formed when the metals are heated with carbon. They liberate hydrogen from dilute acids and burn in halogens to form halides. They form oxides $\\mathbf { M } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ and hydroxides $\\mathrm { { \\bf M } ( O H ) _ { 3 } }$ . The hydroxides are definite compounds, not just hydrated oxides. They are basic like alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides. Their general reactions are depicted in Fig. 4.7. \n\nThe best single use of the lanthanoids is for the production of alloy steels for plates and pipes. A well known alloy is mischmetall which consists of a lanthanoid metal $( \\sim 9 5 \\% )$ and iron $\\left( \\sim 5 \\% \\right)$ and traces of S, C, Ca and Al. A good deal of mischmetall is used in $\\mathbf { M } \\mathbf { g } ^ { \\mathbf { \\alpha } }$ -based alloy to produce bullets, shell and lighter flint. Mixed oxides of lanthanoids are employed as catalysts in petroleum cracking. Some individual Ln oxides are used as phosphors in television screens and similar fluorescing surfaces. \n\n4.6 The Actinoids \n\nThe actinoids include the fourteen elements from Th to Lr. The names, symbols and some properties of these elements are given in Table 4.10. \n\nThe actinoids are radioactive elements and the earlier members have relatively long half-lives, the latter ones have half-life values ranging from a day to 3 minutes for lawrencium $\\scriptstyle [ Z = 1 0 3 ]$ . The latter members could be prepared only in nanogram quantities. These facts render their study more difficult. \n\n4.6.1 Electronic Configurations \n\nAll the actinoids are believed to have the electronic configuration of $7 \\mathrm { { s } ^ { 2 } }$ and variable occupancy of the 5f and 6d subshells. The fourteen electrons are formally added to $5 f ,$ though not in thorium $( Z = 9 0 )$ but from Pa onwards the $5 f$ orbitals are complete at element 103. The irregularities in the electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids are related to the stabilities of the $f ^ { 0 } , f ^ { 7 }$ and $f ^ { 1 4 }$ occupancies of the 5f orbitals. Thus, the configurations of Am and $\\mathrm { C m }$ are [Rn] $5 f ^ {",

The irregularities in the electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids are related to the stabilities of the $f ^ { 0 } , f ^ { 7 }$ and $f ^ { 1 4 }$ occupancies of the 5f orbitals. Thus, the configurations of Am and $\\mathrm { C m }$ are [Rn] $5 f ^ { 7 } 7 s ^ { 2 }$ and [Rn] $5 f ^ { 7 } 6 d ^ { 1 } 7 s ^ { 2 }$ . Although the $5 f$ orbitals resemble the $4 f$ orbitals in their angular part of the wave-function, they are not as buried as $4 f$ orbitals and hence 5f electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent. \n\n4.6.2 Ionic Sizes \n\nThe general trend in lanthanoids is observable in the actinoids as well. There is a gradual decrease in the size of atoms or $\\mathbf { M } ^ { 3 + }$ ions across the series. This may be referred to as the actinoid contraction like lanthanoid contraction). The contraction is, however, greater from element to element in this series resulting from poor shielding by $5 f$ electrons. \n\n4.6.3 Oxidation States \n\nThere is a greater range of oxidation states, which is in part attributed to the fact that the 5f, 6d and 7s levels are of comparable energies. The known oxidation states of actinoids are listed in Table 4.11. \n\nThe actinoids show in general $+ 3$ oxidation state. The elements, in the first half of the series frequently exhibit higher oxidation states. For example, the maximum oxidation state increases from $+ 4$ in Th to $+ 5$ , $+ 6$ and $+ 7$ respectively in Pa, U and Np but decreases in succeeding elements (Table 4.1 1). The actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in having more compounds in $+ 3$ state than in the $+ 4$ state. However, $+ 3$ and $+ 4$ ions tend to hydrolyse. Because the distribution of oxidation states among the actinoids is so uneven and so different for the former and later elements, it is unsatisfactory to review their chemistry in terms of oxidation states. \n\n4.6.4 General Characteristics and Comparison with Lanthanoids \n\nThe actinoid metals are all silvery in appearance but display a variety of structures. The structural variability is obtained due to irregularities in metallic radi which are far greater than in lanthanoids. \n\nThe actinoids are highly reactive metals, especially when finely divided. The action of boiling water on them, for example, gives a mixture of oxide and hydride and combination with most non metals takes place at moderate temperatures. Hydrochloric acid attacks all metals but most are slightly affected by nitric acid owing to the formation of protective oxide layers; alkalies have no action. \n\nThe magnetic properties of the actinoids are more complex than those of the lanthanoids. Although the variation in the magnetic susceptibility of the actinoids with the number of unpaired 5 $f$ electrons is roughly parallel to the corresponding results for the lanthanoids, the latter have higher values. \n\nIt is evident from the behaviour of the actinoids that the ionisation enthalpies of the early actinoids, though not accurately known, but are lower than for the early lanthanoids. This is quite reasonable since it is to be expected that when 5f orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will penetrate less",

This is quite reasonable since it is to be expected that when 5f orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will penetrate less into the inner core of electrons. The 5f electrons, will therefore, be more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge than the $4 f$ electrons of the corresponding lanthanoids. Because the outer electrons are less firmly held, they are available for bonding in the actinoids. \n\nA comparison of the actinoids with the lanthanoids, with respect to different characteristics as discussed above, reveals that behaviour similar to that of the lanthanoids is not evident until the second half of the actinoid series. However, even the early actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in showing close similarities with each other and in gradual variation in properties which do not entail change in oxidation state. The lanthanoid and actinoid contractions, have extended effects on the sizes, and therefore, the properties of the elements succeeding them in their respective periods. The lanthanoid contraction is more important because the chemistry of elements succeeding the actinoids are much less known at the present time. \n\nExample 4.10 Name a member of the lanthanoid series which is well known to exhibit $+ 4$ oxidation state.   \nSolution Cerium $( Z = 5 8 )$ \n\nIntexct Question \n\n4.10 Actinoid contraction is greater from element to element than lanthanoid contraction. why? \n\n4.7 SomeApplicationsof d- andf-BlockElements\n\nIron and steels are the most important construction materials. Their production is based on the reduction of iron oxides, the removal of impurities and the addition of carbon and alloying metals such as Cr, Mn and Ni. Some compounds are manufactured for special purposes such as TiO for the pigment industry and $\\mathbf { M n O } _ { 2 }$ for use in dry battery cells. The battery industry also requires $Z \\mathrm { n }$ and Ni/Cd. The elements of Group 11 are still worthy of being called the coinage metals, although Ag and Au are restricted to collection items and the contemporary UK 'copper' coins are copper-coated steel. The 'silver' UK coins are a Cu/Ni alloy. Many of the metals and/or their compounds are essential catalysts in the chemical industry. $\\mathrm { V } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 }$ catalyses the oxidation of $\\mathrm { S O } _ { 2 }$ in the manufacture of sulphuric acid. $\\mathrm { T i C l } _ { 4 }$ with $\\mathrm { { A 1 } ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } }$ forms the basis of the Ziegler catalysts used to manufacture polyethylene (polythene). Iron catalysts are used in the Haber process for the production of ammonia from $\\mathrm { { N _ { 2 } / H _ { 2 } } }$ mixtures. Nickel catalysts enable the hydrogenation of fats to proceed. In the Wacker process the oxidation of ethyne to ethanal is catalysed by $\\mathrm { P d C l } _ { 2 }$ . Nickel complexes are useful in the polymerisation of alkynes and other organic compounds such as benzene. The photographic industry relies on the special light-sensitive properties of AgBr. \n\nThe d-block consisting of Groups 3-12 occupies the large middle section of the periodic table.

Nickel complexes are useful in the polymerisation of alkynes and other organic compounds such as benzene. The photographic industry relies on the special light-sensitive properties of AgBr. \n\nThe d-block consisting of Groups 3-12 occupies the large middle section of the periodic table. In these elements the inner $d$ orbitals are progressively filled. The f-block is placed outside at the bottom of the periodic table and in the elements of this block, $4 f$ and $5 f$ orbitals are progressively filled. \n\nCorresponding to the filling of $3 d$ i:) $4 d$ and $5 d$ orbitals, three series of transition elements are well recognised. All the transition elements exhibit typical metallic properties such as -high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, thermal and electrical conductivity and metallic character. Their melting and boiling points are high which are attributed to the involvement of $( n { - } 1 ) d$ electrons resulting into strong interatomic bonding. In many of these properties, the maxima occur at about the middle of each series which indicates that one unpaired electron per $d$ orbital is particularly a favourable configuration for strong interatomic interaction. \n\nSuccessive ionisation enthalpies do not increase as steeply as in the main group elements with increasing atomic number Hence, the loss of variable number of electrons from $( n { - } 1 ) d$ orbitals is not energetically unfavourable. The involvement of (n–1) d electrons in the behaviour of transition elements impart certain distinct characteristics to these elements. Thus, in addition to variable oxidation states, they exhibit paramagnetic behaviour, catalytic properties and tendency for the formation of coloured ions, interstitial compounds and complexes. \n\nThe transition elements vary widely in their chemical behaviour. Many of them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are 'noble'. Of the first series, with the exception of copper, all the metals are relatively reactive. \n\nThe transition metals react with a number of non-metals like oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and halogens to form binary compounds. The first series transition metal oxides are generally formed from the reaction of metals with oxygen at high temperatures. These oxides dissolve in acids and bases to form oxometalic salts. Potassium dichromate and potassium permanganate are common examples. Potassium dichromate is prepared from the chromite ore by fusion with alkali in presence of air and acidifying the extract. Pyrolusite ore $\\mathrm { { ( M n O _ { 2 } ) } }$ is used for the preparation of potassium permanganate. Both the dichromate and the permanganate ions are strong oxidising agents. \n\nThe two series of inner transition elements, lanthanoids and actinoids constitute the fblock of the periodic table. with the successive filling of the inner orbitals, $4 f ,$ there is a gradual decrease in the atomic and ionic sizes of these metals along the series (lanthanoid contraction). This has far reaching consequences in the chemistry of the elements succeeding them. Lanthanum and all the lanthanoids are rather soft white metals. They react easily with water to give solutions giving $+ 3$ ions. The principal oxidation state is $+ 3$ although $+ 4$ and $+ 2$ oxidation states are also exhibited by some occasionally. The chemistry of the actinoids is more complex in view of their ability to exist in different oxidation states. Furthermore, many of the actinoid elements are radioactive which make the study of these elements rather difficult. \n\nThere are many useful applications of the $d \\cdot$ and $f$ block elements and their",

The layout is a standard periodic table format with groups as columns and periods as rows. The d-block elements occupy the central portion, spanning groups 3 to 12, and are arranged in four horizontal rows corresponding to the 3d, 4d, 5d, and 6d series. The f-block elements, comprising the lanthanoids (4f series) and actinoids (5f series), are displayed separately in two horizontal rows beneath the main table, emphasizing their placement as a separate panel. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, atomic number, and sometimes additional electronic configuration details. The d-block elements are color-coded to distinguish them from the s- and p-block elements flanking them on either side, with a distinct color scheme for the f-block elements to visually separate them. The image uses clear, legible fonts and a clean, educational style suitable for academic contexts. The lighting and color contrast are optimized for clarity and ease of reading. The image visually supports the surrounding text by illustrating the positions of the d- and f-block elements, their series classification, and their relationship within the periodic table. This visual aid complements the textual explanation of electronic configurations, oxidation states, and the general characteristics of transition and inner transition metals. No dynamic actions or animations are present; the image is a static, informative diagram. The technical detail includes the grouping of elements by their electron filling order and the separation of the f-block to maintain the table's compactness and clarity. This image is integral to understanding the spatial and electronic structure of transition elements as discussed in the surrounding content.",

It is structured with rows representing atomic numbers (Z), element symbols, and the number of electrons in the outer 4s/5s and 3d/4d orbitals. The first series (3d) includes elements from Scandium (Sc, Z=21) to Zinc (Zn, Z=30), and the second series (4d) includes elements from Yttrium (Y, Z=39) to Cadmium (Cd, Z=48). Column headers indicate element symbols and atomic numbers, while rows below specify the electron counts in the outer s and d orbitals. Key data points show the progressive filling of d orbitals from 1 to 10 electrons across each series, with s orbital electrons mostly 1 or 2, except for Zn and Cd where d orbitals are fully filled (10 electrons) and s orbitals have 2 electrons, reflecting their non-transition metal status. Patterns reveal the gradual increase in d-electron count correlating with atomic number, illustrating the characteristic filling of (n-1)d orbitals in transition metals. The table highlights exceptions such as the full d10 configuration in Zn and Cd, supporting the textual explanation that these are not considered transition metals despite their position. Statistically, the d-electron count increases by approximately one per element across the series, with s-electrons mostly stable at 2, except for elements like Cu and Ag where s-electrons are 1, reflecting electron configuration anomalies due to stability of half-filled or fully filled d subshells. The relationship between atomic number, element identity, and electron configuration is clearly depicted, supporting the surrounding content's focus on electronic configurations, the definition of transition metals, and the importance of d orbital filling in chemical properties. This table concretely illustrates the concept that transition metals have incomplete d subshells, except for group 12 elements, and provides foundational data for understanding their chemical behavior and trends in oxidation states and reactivity discussed in the text.",

The column headers likely include element symbols and their corresponding electronic configurations, illustrating the filling of d orbitals and the ns electrons. Key data points include the configurations of elements such as Chromium (Cr) with 3d5 4s1 and Copper (Cu) with 3d10 4s1, which deviate from the expected filling order due to stability of half-filled and fully filled d subshells. Patterns show that the d orbitals fill progressively from 1 to 10 electrons across each series, with ns orbitals typically having one or two electrons, except for noted exceptions. Statistical trends highlight the stability associated with half-filled (d5) and fully filled (d10) d orbitals, influencing chemical properties and reactivity. The relationships between the data elements emphasize the correlation between electronic configuration and the characteristic properties of transition metals, such as variable oxidation states, formation of colored ions, and catalytic behavior. This table supports the surrounding content by providing a foundational reference for understanding the electronic structure of transition elements, which underpins their unique chemical and physical properties discussed in the text.

Key data points include the consistent presence of 2 electrons in the 6s orbital for most elements except Pt and Au, which have 1 electron each, and the progressive filling of the 5d orbital from 1 electron in La to 10 electrons in Au and Hg. The pattern reflects the gradual filling of the 5d subshell across the series, with the 6s electrons generally remaining at 2, except for the late transition metals where electron configuration anomalies occur (e.g., Pt and Au). This aligns with the surrounding context discussing the electronic configurations of transition metals, their exceptions, and the significance of d-orbital filling in determining chemical and physical properties. The table supports the concept that transition elements have partially filled d orbitals, which influence their characteristic properties such as variable oxidation states, magnetic behavior, and catalytic activity. The presence of fully filled 5d orbitals in Hg (10 electrons) correlates with its classification as a non-transition element despite being in the d-block, consistent with the text's explanation about elements like Zn, Cd, Hg not being considered transition metals due to their filled d orbitals. Overall, the table illustrates the electronic structure trends in the third transition series, reinforcing the theoretical framework provided in the surrounding content about d-block element configurations and their implications.",

The atomic numbers range from 89 (Ac) to 112 (Cn), covering actinium through copernicium. The 7s orbital electron count is consistently 2 for all elements except Ac, which is blank, indicating a possible exception or incomplete data. The 6d orbital electrons increase progressively from 1 in Ac to 7 in Ds, with Rg111 and Cn112210 having 28 and 110 electrons respectively, which likely represent cumulative or special notation rather than actual electron counts. This pattern reflects the filling of the 6d orbitals across the 4th transition series, illustrating the gradual increase in d-electron count as atomic number increases. The table supports the surrounding content by providing concrete data on electronic configurations, which underpin the chemical and physical properties discussed, such as oxidation states, magnetic behavior, and bonding characteristics of transition metals. The data also highlight the complexity and exceptions in electron filling, consistent with the text's emphasis on the small energy differences between (n-1)d and ns orbitals and the stability of half-filled and fully filled d subshells. This table thus serves as a foundational reference for understanding the trends and anomalies in the 4th series transition elements' electronic structures.",

Each row lists elements in order of increasing atomic number, with their respective lattice structures indicated below. The column headers are the chemical symbols of the transition metals, grouped horizontally by series: first row for 3d elements (Sc to Zn), second row for 4d elements (Y to Cd), and third row for 5d elements (La to Hg). The lattice structures are given as abbreviations: hcp (hexagonal close packed), bcc (body centred cubic), ccp (cubic close packed), and X indicating a typical metal structure. Parentheses denote alternative or less common structures for the element.\n\nKey data points include the predominance of hcp and bcc structures in early transition metals (Sc, Ti, Y, Zr, La, Hf) and a shift towards ccp structures in later elements (Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, Au). Notably, Mn and Fe show complex or multiple lattice types (bcc, ccp, hcp), reflecting their polymorphic nature. Zn, Cd, and Hg, which have completely filled d orbitals and are not considered transition metals, show atypical lattice structures (X or hcp), consistent with their distinct physical properties discussed in the surrounding text.\n\nStatistically, bcc structures dominate the middle of the series (V, Cr, Nb, Mo, Ta, W, Re, Os), while ccp structures are more common towards the end of the series. The presence of multiple lattice types for some elements indicates structural polymorphism influenced by temperature or pressure. The table illustrates the relationship between electronic configuration and crystal structure, supporting the text's discussion on how d orbital filling affects metallic bonding and physical properties such as hardness and melting points.\n\nThe data underscores the trend that early transition metals with fewer d electrons favor more open bcc or hcp lattices, while later metals with more d electrons stabilize denser ccp lattices. This correlates with the text's explanation of stronger interatomic bonding and higher melting points near half-filled d orbitals. The table also visually supports the concept of group and period similarities in physical properties, as elements in the same group or series often share lattice types, reflecting their similar atomic sizes and bonding characteristics. Overall, the table complements the discussion on transition metal properties by linking crystal structure to electronic configuration and periodic trends.",

The x-axis is labeled with atomic numbers or element positions corresponding to the transition metals, while the y-axis indicates melting points in degrees Celsius, ranging approximately from 0 to 3500°C. Three distinct colored lines or curves represent the melting point trends for each series: 3d (first row), 4d (second row), and 5d (third row) transition metals. The 3d series line shows a rise in melting points reaching a peak near the middle of the series (around d5 configuration), followed by a decline, with notable anomalies such as manganese (Mn) and technetium (Tc) deviating from the general trend. The 4d and 5d series lines generally show higher melting points than the 3d series, with the 5d series often having the highest values, reflecting stronger metallic bonding due to involvement of more d electrons. The graph uses different colors or markers to distinguish the series, and the background is plain white with grid lines to aid reading values. The visual style is scientific and clear, suitable for educational purposes, with precise plotting of data points connected by smooth lines. This figure complements the surrounding text discussing the physical properties of transition metals, specifically their melting points and the role of d-electrons in metallic bonding. It visually supports the explanation that melting points peak at half-filled d orbitals and that heavier transition metals (4d and 5d) have higher melting points due to stronger interatomic interactions. The image is integral to understanding the periodic trends and physical characteristics of transition elements as described in the adjacent content.",

The horizontal axis represents the atomic number (Z) of elements, ranging approximately from 21 (Scandium) to 30 (Zinc) for the first series, and extending similarly for the second and third series. The vertical axis measures atomic radii in picometers (pm), with values roughly between 120 pm and 180 pm. Three distinct curves are plotted, each corresponding to one of the three transition metal series: the 3d series (first row), 4d series (second row), and 5d series (third row). The 3d series curve starts at a higher radius and shows a gradual decrease as atomic number increases. The 4d series curve lies above the 3d series curve, indicating generally larger atomic radii, but follows a similar decreasing trend. The 5d series curve closely overlaps with the 4d series curve, demonstrating nearly identical atomic radii values, which visually represents the lanthanoid contraction effect described in the surrounding text. The graph uses different colors or line styles to distinguish the three series, with clear markers at each element's atomic number. The background is white with grid lines to aid in reading values. The title is positioned above the graph, and axis labels are clearly marked. The visual style is scientific and precise, suitable for academic use. This graph directly supports the textual explanation on page 4 about the variation in atomic and ionic sizes of transition metals, highlighting the lanthanoid contraction and its impact on atomic radii across the series.",

The columns represent individual elements, while the rows list various properties including atomic number, electronic configurations for neutral atoms and ions (M, M+, M2+, M3+), enthalpy of atomisation (∆aH° in kJ/mol), ionisation enthalpies (first, second, and third), metallic/ionic radii (in pm), standard electrode potentials (E° in volts) for M2+/M and M3+/M2+ couples, and density (g/cm³). The electronic configurations highlight the filling of 3d and 4s orbitals and their changes upon ionisation, illustrating the gradual filling of d orbitals across the series. The enthalpy of atomisation values show a general trend of high values for early transition metals like Titanium (515 kJ/mol) and Vanadium (397 kJ/mol), with a notable low for Zinc (126 kJ/mol), supporting the text's explanation that Zn has the lowest enthalpy due to its filled d10 configuration and lack of unpaired electrons. Ionisation enthalpies increase across the series, but with irregularities at elements like Manganese and Iron, reflecting the stability of half-filled (d5) and more stable d6 configurations, consistent with the surrounding discussion on exchange energy and electronic stability. The metallic radii decrease slightly across the series, consistent with the lanthanoid contraction and imperfect shielding effects described. Standard electrode potentials vary, indicating differing tendencies to lose electrons and form ions, with more positive values for elements like Iron (+0.34 V for M2+/M) reflecting greater stability of certain oxidation states. Density increases from Scandium (3.43 g/cm³) to Copper (8.9 g/cm³), illustrating the combined effect of decreasing atomic radius and increasing atomic mass. Overall, the table quantitatively supports the textual concepts of atomic and ionic size variation, ionisation enthalpy trends, enthalpy of atomisation differences, and their chemical implications in the first transition series.",

The subsequent rows enumerate the common oxidation states exhibited by each element, with some cells spanning multiple rows or columns to indicate multiple oxidation states for a single element. The oxidation states are presented as integers with some elements showing multiple states in a single cell (e.g., '+3+4' for Ti and Co). Key data points include the observation that Scandium predominantly exhibits a +3 oxidation state, while Manganese (Mn) shows the widest range from +2 to +7, illustrating its chemical versatility. Early transition metals like Sc and Ti have fewer oxidation states, mostly lower values, whereas middle series elements such as V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co display a broader range of oxidation states, including higher ones like +6 and +7. Late transition metals like Cu and Zn have fewer and lower oxidation states, with Zn limited to +2. The table supports the surrounding content by visually confirming the textual explanation that the number of oxidation states peaks near the middle of the series due to the balance of available d electrons for bonding and decreases at the ends due to electron configuration constraints. The presence of multiple oxidation states for elements like V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co aligns with the discussion on variable oxidation states arising from incomplete d orbital filling. The table also illustrates the chemical stability trends mentioned, such as the rarity of Sc(II) and the stability of Ti(IV), and the limited oxidation states of Zn due to its filled d10 configuration. This structured presentation of oxidation states complements the detailed theoretical discussion on ionisation enthalpies, electronic configurations, and exchange energy effects influencing the chemical behavior of transition metals.",

The graph plots standard electrode potentials (E^{\\circ}) on the vertical axis against the elements of the 3d transition metal series on the horizontal axis, specifically from titanium (Ti) to zinc (Zn). The horizontal axis lists the elements in order: Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn. The vertical axis is labeled with potential values in volts, ranging approximately from -2.0 V to +0.5 V. Two distinct data series are shown: one representing observed values and the other representing calculated values. The observed values are marked with solid symbols (likely dots or squares), while the calculated values are represented by a line or connected points, allowing direct comparison between experimental and theoretical data. The graph shows a general trend of increasing electrode potential from Ti to Cu, with Cu having a positive electrode potential (+0.34 V), which is unique among the series. Notably, the values for Mn, Ni, and Zn deviate from the smooth trend, appearing more negative than expected, consistent with the surrounding text discussing their electronic configurations and stability. The graph uses a clean, scientific style with clear axis labels, a legend distinguishing observed and calculated data, and grid lines to aid in reading values. The color scheme likely uses contrasting colors or shades to differentiate the two data sets, with a white or light background and dark text and lines for clarity. This visual representation supports the textual discussion on page 8 about the trends in standard electrode potentials across the 3d transition metals, highlighting the unique behavior of copper and the deviations for manganese, nickel, and zinc. The graph effectively illustrates the relationship between electronic structure and electrochemical properties in the transition series.",

The elements listed are the first-row transition metals Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn. Key data points include the positive standard electrode potential for Cu (+0.34 V), which contrasts with the generally negative values for other metals, reflecting its unique chemical behavior. The ionization enthalpies generally increase across the series, contributing to a trend of less negative E° values from Ti (-1.63 V) to Cu (+0.34 V). Notably, Mn (-1.18 V), Ni (-0.25 V), and Zn (-0.76 V) deviate from the smooth trend, linked to their electronic configurations and stability of half-filled or filled d-subshells. The hydration enthalpy values are highly negative, indicating strong solvation of M²⁺ ions, with Ni and Cu sharing the most negative hydration enthalpy (-2121 kJ mol⁻¹). The table supports the surrounding discussion by quantifying the thermochemical parameters that influence the standard electrode potentials, explaining phenomena such as Cu's inability to liberate H₂ from acids due to its high atomization enthalpy and relatively low hydration enthalpy. The data also illustrate the relationship between ionization energies, hydration enthalpies, and electrode potentials, underpinning the stability and redox behavior of the transition metal ions in aqueous solution. This table is foundational for understanding the trends in M²⁺/M electrode potentials and rationalizing exceptions based on electronic structure and thermodynamics.",

The halides are represented with general formulas such as TiX4, VF5, CrF6, and others, where X denotes halogens (F, Cl, Br, I) as clarified in the footnotes. The table shows that the highest oxidation states (+6, +5, +4) are mainly achieved by early 3d metals like Cr, V, and Ti, with specific fluorides such as CrF6 and VF5. Mid-series metals like Mn exhibit halides in +4 and +3 states (MnF4, MnF3), while later metals like Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn show stable halides primarily in +3 and +2 states, with Cu and Zn also forming halides in +1 and +2 states respectively. Notably, the +7 oxidation state is absent in simple halides but mentioned in the context as existing in compounds like MnO3F. The table supports the surrounding discussion on the stability of higher oxidation states in 3d metals, highlighting the role of fluorine in stabilizing high oxidation states due to lattice energy and bond enthalpy. It also illustrates the trend that fluorides are more stable at higher oxidation states compared to other halides, which often undergo hydrolysis or disproportionation. The data aligns with the text's explanation of electronic configurations influencing stability, such as half-filled and fully filled d subshells, and the unique chemistry of copper and manganese. Overall, the table provides a clear visual summary of the halide chemistry of 3d metals, reinforcing concepts of oxidation state stability, ligand effects, and electronic structure discussed in the surrounding content.",

In the context of electrode potentials and transition metal chemistry, this equation exemplifies the disproportionation and redox behavior of copper ions, illustrating the instability of Cu^+ in aqueous solution and the formation of mixed oxidation state compounds. Physically, it demonstrates the reduction of Cu^{2+} to Cu^+ and simultaneous oxidation of I^- to I_2, highlighting the interplay between ionization enthalpies, electrode potentials, and chemical stability. The equation relates to the broader discussion on the stability of oxidation states, redox potentials, and the chemical reactivity of transition metals, particularly copper.

The presence of oxides like Sc2O3 (+3), TiO (likely TiO, +2), and CuO (+2) illustrates the range of stable oxidation states across the series. The data reveals that the highest oxidation states are generally achieved by early transition metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn), consistent with the surrounding text's discussion on the stability of higher oxidation states and the role of oxygen in stabilizing these states. The table supports the concept that oxygen stabilizes higher oxidation states more effectively than halides, as seen in the existence of high oxidation state oxides like Mn2O7 (+7) and CrO3 (+6). The progression of oxides from lower to higher oxidation states across the 3d series reflects the increasing oxidizing power and the ability of metals to form multiple bonds with oxygen, as highlighted in the surrounding content. This table concretely illustrates the chemical diversity and oxidation state variability of 3d transition metals, reinforcing the text's explanation of trends in oxidation states, stability, and chemical reactivity.",

Mathematically, it is a balanced chemical equation: 2 Cr^{2+} (aq) + 2 H^{+} (aq) -> 2 Cr^{3+} (aq) + H_2 (g). The variables are Cr^{2+} and Cr^{3+}, representing chromium ions in different oxidation states, H^{+} representing protons in solution, and H_2 representing diatomic hydrogen gas. The stoichiometric coefficients indicate the molar ratios of reactants and products, ensuring mass and charge balance. The equation involves oxidation-reduction (redox) processes, where chromium(II) is oxidized (loses electrons) and protons are reduced (gain electrons). This reaction is significant in the context of transition metal chemistry, illustrating the variable oxidation states of chromium and its redox behavior in aqueous acidic media. It relates to the broader discussion on ionization enthalpies, redox potentials (E° values), and the stability of different oxidation states of transition metals. The reaction exemplifies how the chemical reactivity and redox properties of transition metals depend on their electronic configurations and the solution environment. Practically, such redox reactions are fundamental in electrochemistry, analytical chemistry, and industrial processes involving chromium compounds. The equation also connects to the theme of oxidizing power and the role of ionization energies in determining redox behavior, as discussed in the surrounding content.",

Here, \\( \\mu \\) denotes the magnetic moment measured in Bohr magnetons (BM), and \\( n \\) is the number of unpaired electrons in the d-orbitals of the metal ion. The formula arises from the quantum mechanical treatment of electron spin, where each unpaired electron contributes a spin angular momentum of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) and an associated magnetic moment. The term \\( n(n+2) \\) comes from the total spin quantum number \\( S = \\frac{n}{2} \\), and the magnetic moment is calculated as \\( \\mu = g \\sqrt{S(S+1)} \\) with the Landé g-factor approximated as 2, simplifying to the given expression. This formula neglects orbital angular momentum contributions, which are often quenched in first-row transition metal complexes due to ligand field effects. The equation is significant in interpreting magnetic susceptibility data, providing insights into the electronic configuration and oxidation state of metal ions. It relates directly to the paramagnetic behavior discussed in the context, where unpaired electrons cause attraction to magnetic fields.

The Ion column lists first-row transition metal ions in their common oxidation states (e.g., Sc3+, Ti3+, Ti2+, V2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+). The Configuration column shows the d-electron configuration for each ion, ranging from d0 (Sc3+) to d10 (Zn2+). The Unpaired electron(s) column quantifies the number of unpaired electrons in each ion, from 0 to 5. The Calculated Magnetic Moment column provides theoretical values derived from the spin-only formula (μ = √(n(n+2)) Bohr Magnetons), while the Observed Magnetic Moment column lists experimentally measured values, mostly for hydrated ions in solution or solid state.\n\nKey data points include the perfect match of calculated and observed magnetic moments for ions with 0 unpaired electrons (Sc3+, Zn2+), and close agreement for ions with 1 to 3 unpaired electrons (e.g., Ti3+, Ti2+, V2+). For ions with 4 or 5 unpaired electrons (Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+), observed magnetic moments are slightly higher than calculated values, indicating possible contributions beyond spin-only moments, such as orbital angular momentum or experimental factors. Notably, Co2+ shows a wider observed range (4.4 - 5.2 BM) compared to the calculated 4.90 BM, suggesting variability in coordination environment or ligand effects.\n\nThe table illustrates the relationship between electronic configuration, number of unpaired electrons, and magnetic properties, supporting the surrounding content's explanation that magnetic moments arise primarily from unpaired electrons and can be estimated by the spin-only formula. The slight discrepancies between calculated and observed values highlight the limitations of the spin-only model and the influence of other factors like orbital contributions and ligand field effects. This data substantiates the discussion on paramagnetism in first-row transition metal ions and provides empirical evidence for the theoretical concepts presented in section 4.3.9 Magnetic Properties.\n\nOverall, the table serves as a practical reference linking electronic structure to magnetic behavior, reinforcing the concept that the number of unpaired electrons is a key determinant of magnetic moment, while also acknowledging real-world complexities in observed measurements.",

The first column lists the 3d electron configurations of the ions, the second column provides specific ion examples (e.g., Ti3+, V4+, Mn2+), and the third column shows the corresponding colour of the ion in solution. The table covers ions with configurations ranging from 3d0 to 3d10. Key data points include the correlation between the d-electron count and the colour exhibited by the ion, illustrating how electronic transitions within d orbitals result in absorption of visible light and thus impart characteristic colours. For example, Ti3+ (3d1) appears purple, V3+ (3d2) is green, Mn2+ (3d5) is pink, and Cu2+ (3d9) is blue. The trend shows that ions with partially filled d orbitals absorb specific wavelengths of light, leading to a variety of colours, while ions with empty (3d0) or full (3d10) d subshells are colourless. This supports the surrounding content's explanation that the colour of transition metal ions arises from d-d electronic transitions influenced by ligand fields, here specifically water ligands in aqueous solutions. The table concretely illustrates the concept that the nature of the ligand and the d-electron configuration determine the frequency of light absorbed and thus the observed colour. It also complements the discussion on paramagnetism and electronic configuration by linking electronic structure to optical properties. The data highlights the diversity of colours in first-row transition metal ions and underscores the importance of d orbital electron count in determining both magnetic and optical characteristics.",

Both structures are rendered in a ball-and-stick molecular model style, emphasizing atomic connectivity and geometry. The chromate ion is depicted as a single tetrahedral unit with a central chromium atom (likely represented by a larger, differently colored sphere) bonded to four oxygen atoms arranged symmetrically around it, forming a classic tetrahedral shape. The oxygen atoms are shown as smaller spheres connected to the chromium by sticks representing chemical bonds. The dichromate ion structure consists of two such tetrahedral chromium-oxygen units joined by a bridging oxygen atom, creating a Cr-O-Cr linkage. This linkage is highlighted by the shared oxygen atom connecting the two chromium centers, resulting in a bent or angular overall shape rather than two isolated tetrahedra. The Cr-O-Cr bond angle is visually evident as less than 180 degrees, consistent with the stated 126° angle in the surrounding text. The color scheme likely uses standard conventions, with chromium atoms in a distinct color (such as orange or purple) and oxygen atoms in red, set against a white or neutral background to enhance clarity. The lighting is uniform and bright, ensuring all atoms and bonds are clearly visible without shadows or reflections. The image style is scientific and schematic, designed for educational purposes to illustrate the structural differences and similarities between the chromate and dichromate ions. This visual directly supports the surrounding textual content on page 16, which discusses the chemical nature, structure, and interconversion of chromate and dichromate ions, including their tetrahedral geometry and the shared oxygen bridge in dichromate.

Mathematically, these are balanced chemical equations expressing conservation of mass and charge. Variables include chemical species: MnO2 (manganese dioxide), KOH (potassium hydroxide), O2 (oxygen), K2MnO4 (potassium manganate), H2O (water), MnO4^2- (manganate ion), H+ (proton), and MnO4^- (permanganate ion).

The first equation shows the alkaline oxidation of MnO2 to manganate ion, while the second depicts the disproportionation of manganate ion in acidic medium to permanganate, MnO2, and water. These reactions are central in inorganic chemistry, particularly transition metal redox chemistry, illustrating oxidation state changes of manganese from +4 in MnO2 to +6 in manganate and +7 in permanganate. The equations relate to the broader discussion of transition metal oxides, their oxidation states, and their redox behavior, highlighting the practical synthesis of potassium permanganate, a strong oxidizing agent used in analytical chemistry and industrial applications. The theoretical significance lies in understanding electron transfer processes, redox equilibria, and the structural chemistry of manganese oxoanions.

The graph is plotted on a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with the x-axis labeled with the lanthanoid elements, likely from lanthanum (La) to lutetium (Lu), and the y-axis representing ionic radii measured in picometers (pm). The data points form a generally decreasing trend from left to right, illustrating the lanthanoid contraction phenomenon where ionic radii decrease with increasing atomic number. The graph likely includes markers or points for each lanthanoid ion, connected by a line to emphasize the trend. The background is white with clear black axes and grid lines for readability. The colors used are minimal, focusing on clarity and scientific presentation, possibly with blue or black data points and lines. The graph is consistent with the surrounding text discussing the lanthanoid contraction, electronic configurations, and atomic/ionic sizes, providing a visual confirmation of the gradual decrease in ionic radii across the series. The image serves as a technical illustration supporting the chemical concepts described on the page, particularly the effect of imperfect electron shielding in the 4f subshell on ionic size. No additional annotations or legends are visible, but the graph is straightforward and typical of inorganic chemistry literature. The lighting is uniform and the style is formal and academic, suitable for a textbook or scientific publication.",

and Radii of Lanthanum and Lanthanoids' is organized with rows representing individual lanthanoid elements, identified by atomic number, name, and symbol. The columns are divided into two main groups: electronic configurations and atomic/ionic radii. The electronic configuration columns specify the electron arrangements for the neutral lanthanoid atom (Ln), the divalent ion (Ln2+), and the trivalent ion (Ln3+), focusing on electrons outside the [Xe] core, particularly the 4f, 5d, and 6s orbitals. The radii columns provide atomic radii and ionic radii for the trivalent ions in picometers (pm). Key data points show a general trend of decreasing atomic and ionic radii from lanthanum (La, atomic number 57) to lutetium (Lu, atomic number 71), illustrating the lanthanoid contraction phenomenon. For example, atomic radius decreases from 187 pm for La to 173 pm for Yb, and ionic radius decreases from 106 pm for La3+ to 86 pm for Yb3+. The electronic configurations reveal the progressive filling of the 4f subshell from 4f0 in La to 4f14 in Lu, with variations in 5d and 6s occupancy. The table supports the surrounding content by providing empirical data that underpins the discussion on electronic configurations, oxidation states, and the lanthanoid contraction effect. It illustrates how the gradual filling of 4f orbitals correlates with the steady decrease in size, which affects chemical properties such as oxidation states and reactivity. The data also highlight exceptions and irregularities, such as the presence of 5d electrons in some configurations and the anomalous radii values for certain elements like europium (Eu) with a larger atomic radius (199 pm) compared to its neighbors, reflecting its unique electronic structure and oxidation behavior. Overall, the table concretely demonstrates the electronic and size trends that influence the chemistry of lanthanoids, as discussed in sections 4.5.1 to 4.5.4 of the text.",

Mathematically, it describes the gain of three electrons (\\(3 \\mathrm{e^-}\\)) by the trivalent lanthanoid ion (\\(\\mathrm{Ln^{3+}}\\)) to form the neutral lanthanoid metal (\\(\\mathrm{Ln(s)}\\)). The variables include \\(\\mathrm{Ln^{3+}(aq)}\\), denoting a lanthanoid ion with a +3 oxidation state in aqueous phase, and \\(\\mathrm{e^-}\\), the electron. The operation is a redox process involving electron transfer, fundamental in electrochemistry and coordination chemistry. This equation is central to understanding the chemical behavior of lanthanoids, particularly their common +3 oxidation state and their reduction potentials. It relates to the broader discussion of lanthanoid electronic configurations, oxidation states, and their chemical reactivity, including their role in forming alloys and compounds. The equation also connects to the concept of standard electrode potentials (\\(E^\\circ\\)) mentioned in the context, which quantify the tendency of these ions to be reduced. Practically, this reaction underpins processes such as metal extraction, electrochemical synthesis, and analytical chemistry involving lanthanoids. The equation encapsulates the fundamental redox chemistry that governs the stability and transformations of lanthanoid elements within the discussed chemical framework.",

The layout is organized with a central representation of a lanthanoid metal (denoted as M) from which arrows extend outward to various reaction products and compounds. The central element is depicted as a metallic silver-gray sphere or block, symbolizing the silvery white soft metal characteristic of lanthanoids. Surrounding this central metal are several labeled chemical species and reaction pathways. These include oxides (M2O3), hydroxides (M(OH)3), halides, carbides (Ln3C, Ln2C3, LnC2), and hydrides, each connected by arrows indicating the direction of chemical transformation. The oxides and hydroxides are shown as solid compounds, emphasizing their definite compound nature rather than mere hydrated oxides. The halides and carbides are represented with their chemical formulas, highlighting the lanthanoids' ability to form these compounds upon reaction with halogens and carbon, respectively. The diagram uses a clean, technical style with clear, legible chemical formulas and arrows, likely in black or dark ink on a white background, consistent with textbook schematic conventions. The image visually summarizes the general chemical behavior of lanthanoids as described in the surrounding text, such as their reactions with hydrogen, carbon, halogens, and acids, and their formation of basic oxides and hydroxides. The visual style is functional and educational, designed to complement the detailed chemical descriptions on page 21, providing a quick reference to the typical reactions and compounds of lanthanoids. There are no people or natural scenes; the focus is entirely on chemical species and reaction pathways. The image effectively connects to the textual content by visually representing the chemical reactions and compounds discussed, aiding in understanding the lanthanoids' chemical characteristics and their practical applications in alloy steels and catalysts.",

The table is organized into columns representing Atomic Number, Name, Symbol, Electronic Configurations (divided into M, M3+, and M4+ states), and Ionic Radii in picometers for M3+ and M4+ ions. The electronic configurations detail the occupancy of 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals, highlighting the variable electron distribution characteristic of actinoids. Ionic radii data show a general trend of decreasing size across the series, consistent with the actinoid contraction phenomenon described in the surrounding text. Notably, some radii values are missing for heavier elements (Es to Lr), reflecting experimental challenges due to radioactivity and scarcity. The table supports the textual discussion on the irregularities in electronic configurations, the variable oxidation states (notably +3 and +4), and the structural variability of actinoid metals. It illustrates the gradual filling of 5f orbitals and the corresponding changes in ionic sizes, which influence chemical behavior and bonding. The data also emphasize the greater participation of 5f electrons in bonding compared to 4f electrons in lanthanoids, as inferred from the configurations and radii variations. This table thus concretely underpins the concepts of electronic structure, ionic size trends, and oxidation state variability in actinoids as introduced in the surrounding content.",

The table is organized with element symbols as column headers in the first row, followed by rows listing their possible oxidation states. Each cell contains oxidation state values, with some elements showing multiple states in the same cell (e.g., '3 3' for Uranium (U) and Neptunium (Np), indicating multiple +3 states or possibly a typographical duplication). The oxidation states range from +3 to +7, with +3 being the most common and consistent across all elements. Thorium (Th) uniquely shows +4 but no +3 state listed, while Pa, U, Np, Pu, Am, and Cm exhibit higher oxidation states up to +7 in Np. The later actinoids (Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, Md, No, Lr) predominantly show only the +3 state, indicating a contraction in oxidation state variety. This pattern aligns with the surrounding text's explanation that early actinoids exhibit a wider range of oxidation states due to comparable energies of 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals, while later actinoids stabilize mostly in +3. The table supports the concept of actinoid contraction and the complexity of their chemistry compared to lanthanoids, illustrating the uneven distribution of oxidation states and the tendency for higher oxidation states in the first half of the series. It also reflects the difficulty in studying later actinoids due to their short half-lives and limited quantities. The data underscores the chemical behavior trends discussed, such as the prevalence of +3 and +4 states and the decrease in maximum oxidation states in later elements, reinforcing the narrative on actinoid electronic configurations and bonding capabilities.",

In modern terminology such compounds are called coordination compounds. The chemistry of coordination compounds is an important and challenging area of modern inorganic chemistry. New concepts of chemical bonding and molecular structure have provided insights into the functioning of these compounds as vital components of biological systems. Chlorophyl, haemoglobin and vitamin $\\mathrm { { B } } _ { 1 2 }$ are coordination compounds of magnesium, iron and cobalt respectively. Variety of metallurgical processes, industrial catalysts and analytical reagents involve the use of coordination compounds. Coordination compounds also find many applications in electroplating, textile dyeing and medicinal chemistry. \n\n5.1 Werner's Theory of Coordination Compounds \n\nAlfred werner (1866-1919), a Swiss chemist was the first to formulate his ideas about the structures of coordination compounds. He prepared and characterised a large number of coordination compounds and studied their physical and chemical behaviour by simple experimental techniques. Werner proposed the concept of a primary valence and a secondary valence for a metal ion. Binary compounds such as $\\mathrm { C r C l } _ { 3 }$ , $\\mathrm { C o C l } _ { 2 }$ or $\\mathrm { P d C l } _ { 2 }$ have primary valence of 3, 2 and 2 respectively. In a series of compounds of cobalt(ll) chloride with ammonia, it was found that some of the chloride ions could be precipitated as AgCl on adding excess silver nitrate solution in cold but some remained in solution. \n\n1mol (cid:) $\\mathrm { C o C l _ { 3 } . 6 N H _ { 3 } }$ (Yellow) gave 3 mol AgC1   \n1 mol CoCl3.5NH3 (Purple) gave 2 mol AgCl   \n1 mol CoCl3.4NH3 (Green) gave 1 mol AgCl   \n1 mol CoCl3.4NH3 (Violet) gave 1 mol AgCl \n\nThese observations, together with the results of conductivity measurements in solution can be explained if (i) six groups in all, either chloride ions or ammonia molecules or both, remain bonded to the cobalt ion during the reaction and (i) the compounds are formulated as shown in Table 5.1, where the atoms within the square brackets form a single entity which does not dissociate under the reaction conditions. Werner proposed the term secondary valence for the number of groups bound directly to the metal ion; in each of these examples the secondary valences are six. - \n\nNote that the last two compounds in Table 5.1 have identical empirical formula, $\\mathrm { C o C l _ { 3 } . 4 N H _ { 3 } }$ , but distinct properties. Such compounds are termed as isomers. Werner in 1898, propounded his theory of coordination compounds. The main postulates are: \n\n1. In coordination compounds metals show two types",

Such compounds are termed as isomers. Werner in 1898, propounded his theory of coordination compounds. The main postulates are: \n\n1. In coordination compounds metals show two types of linkages (valences)-primary and secondary.   \n2. The primary valences are normally ionisable and are satisfied by negative ions.   \n3. The secondary valences are non ionisable. These are satisfied by neutral molecules or negative ions. The secondary valence is equal to the coordination number and is fixed for a metal.   \n4. The ions/groups bound by the secondary linkages to the metal have characteristic spatial arrangements corresponding to different coordination numbers. \n\n$\\operatorname { I n }$ modern formulations, such spatial arrangements are called coordination polyhedra. The species within the square bracket are coordination entities or complexes and the ions outside the square bracket are called counter ions. \n\nHe further postulated that octahedral, tetrahedral and square planar geometrical shapes are more common in coordination compounds of transition metals. Thus, $\\mathrm { \\left[ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } \\right] ^ { 3 + } }$ , $\\mathrm { [ C o C l ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } ] ^ { 2 + } }$ and $\\mathrm { { [ C o \\bar { C } l _ { 2 } ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 4 } ] } ^ { + } }$ are octahedral entities, while $\\mathrm { [ N i ( C O ) _ { 4 } ] }$ and $\\mathrm { [ P t C l _ { 4 } ] } ^ { 2 - }$ are tetrahedral and square planar, respectively. \n\nOn the basis of the following observations made with aqueous solutions, Example 5.1 assign secondary valences to metals in the following compounds: \n\n(i) Secondary 4 (ii) Secondary 6 Solution (ii) Secondary 6 (iv) Secondary 6 (v) Secondary 4 \n\nDifference between a double salt and a complex \n\nBoth double salts as well as complexes are formed by the combination of two or more stable compounds in stoichiometric ratio. However, they differ in the fact that double salts such as carnallite, $\\mathrm { K C l . M g C l _ { 2 } . 6 H _ { 2 } O }$ , Mohr's salt, $\\mathrm { F e S O _ { 4 } }$ . $\\mathrm { ( N H _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } S O _ { 4 } } . 6 \\mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ , potash alum, $\\mathrm { K A l } ( \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } . 1 2 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ etc. dissociate into simple ions completely when dissolved in water. However, complex ions such as $\\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 4 - } }$ of $\\mathrm { K _ { 4 } } \\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] }$ do not dissociate into $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ and CN ions. \n\nWermer was born on December 12, 1866, in Mülhouse, a small community in the French",

His study of chemistry began in Karlsruhe (Germany) and continued in Zurich (Switzerland), where in his doctoral thesis in l890, he explained the difference in properties of certain nitrogen containing organic substances on the basis of isomerism. He extended vant Hoff's theory of tetrahedral carbon atom and modified it for nitrogen. werner showed optical and electrical differences between complex compounds based on physical measurements. In fact, Werner was the first to discover optical activity in certain coordination compounds. \n\nHe, at the age of 29 years became a full professor at Technische Hochschule in Zurich in 1895. Alfred Werner was a chemist and educationist. His accomplishments included the development of the theory of coordination compounds. This theory, in which Werner proposed revolutionary ideas about how atoms and molecules are linked together, was formulated in a span of only three years, from 1890 to 1893. The remainder of his career was spent gathering the experimental support required to validate his new ideas. Werner became the first Swiss chemist to win the Nobel Prize in 1913 for his work on the linkage of atoms and the coordination theory. \n\n5.2 Definitions of Some Important Terms Pertaining to Coordination Compounds (a) Coordination entity \n\nA coordination entity constitutes a central metal atom or ion bonded to a fixed number of ions or molecules. For example, $\\mathrm { [ C o C l _ { 3 } ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } ] }$ is a coordination entity in which the cobalt ion is surrounded by three ammonia molecules and three chloride ions. Other examples are $\\mathrm { [ N i ( C O ) _ { 4 } ] }$ , $\\mathrm { [ P t C l _ { 2 } ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } ] }$ , $\\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 4 - } }$ , $\\mathrm { \\left[ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } \\right] ^ { 3 + } }$ . \n\n(b) Central atom/ion \n\nIn a coordination entity, the atom/ion to which a fixed number of ions/groups are bound in a definite geometrical arrangement around it, is called the central atom or ion. For example, the central atom/ion in the coordination entities: $\\mathrm { [ N i C l _ { 2 } ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 4 } ] }$ , $\\mathrm { \\small { [ C o C l ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } ] } ^ { 2 + } }$ and $\\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ are $\\mathrm { N i } ^ { 2 + }$ $\\mathrm { C o } ^ { 3 + }$ and $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }$ , respectively. These central atoms/ions are also referred to as Lewis acids. \n\n(c) Ligands \n\nCH2COO   \nH₂C—N CH2COOCH2COO  \nH₂C—N CH2COO\n\nThe ions or molecules bound to the central atom/ion in the coordination entity are called ligands.

Ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion $\\mathrm { ( E D T A ^ { 4 - } ) }$ is an important hexadentate ligand. It can bind through two nitrogen and four oxygen atoms to a central metal ion. \n\nWhen a di- or polydentate ligand uses its two or more donor atoms simultaneously to bind a single metal ion, it is said to be a chelate ligand. The number of such ligating groups is called the denticity of the ligand. Such complexes, called chelate complexes tend to be more stable than similar complexes containing unidentate ligands.

For example, in the complex ions, $\\mathrm { [ P t C l _ { 6 } ] } ^ { 2 - }$ and $\\mathrm { [ N i ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 + } }$ , the coordination number of $\\mathrm { P t }$ and $\\mathbf { N i }$ are 6 and 4 respectively. Similarly, in the complex ions, $\\mathrm { | F e ( C _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } ) _ { 3 } | ^ { 3 - } }$ and $\\mathrm { [ C o ( e n ) _ { 3 } ] ^ { 3 + } }$ , the coordination number of both, Fe and $\\mathbf { C o }$ , is 6 because $\\mathrm { { C _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } } ^ { 2 - } }$ and en (ethane-1,2-diamine) are didentate ligands. \n\nIt is important to note here that coordination number of the central atom/ion is determined only by the number of sigma bonds formed by the ligand with the central atom/ion. Pi bonds, if formed between the ligand and the central atom/ion, are not counted for this purpose. \n\n(e) Coordination sphere \n\nThe central atom/ion and the ligands attached to it are enclosed in square bracket and is collectively termed as the coordination sphere. The ionisable groups are written outside the bracket and are called counter ions. For example, in the complex $\\mathrm { K _ { 4 } [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] }$ , the coordination sphere is $\\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 4 - } }$ and the counter ion is $\\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ . \n\n(f) Coordination polyhedron \n\nThe spatial arrangement of the ligand atoms which are directly attached to the central atom/ion defines a coordination polyhedron about the central atom. The most common coordination polyhedra are octahedral, square planar and tetrahedral. For example, $\\mathrm { \\left[ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } \\right] ^ { 3 + } }$ is octahedral, $\\mathrm { [ N i ( C O ) _ { 4 } ] }$ is tetrahedral and $\\mathrm { [ P t C l _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 - } }$ is square planar. Fig. 5.1 shows the shapes of different coordination polyhedra. \n\n(g) Oxidation number of central atom The oxidation number of the central atom in a complex is defined as the charge it would carry if all the ligands are removed along with the electron pairs that are shared with the central atom. The oxidation number is represented by a Roman numeral in parenthesis following the name of the coordination entity. For example, oxidation number of copper in $\\mathrm { \\Delta [ C u ( C N ) _ { 4 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ is $+ 1$ and it is written as $\\mathrm { C u ( I ) }$ .   \n(h) Homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes Complexes in which a metal is bound to only one kind of donor groups, e.g., $\\mathrm { \\left[ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } \\right] ^",

The formulas and names adopted for coordination entities are based on the recommendations of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). \n\n5.3.1 Formulas of Mononuclear Coordination Entities \n\nNote: The 2004 IUPAC draft recommends that ligands will be sorted alphabetically, irrespective of charge. \n\n5.3.2 Naming of Mononuclear Coordination Compounds \n\nNote: The 2004   \nIUPAC draft   \nrecommends that   \nanionic ligands will end with-ido so that chloro would become chlorido, etc. \n\nThe formula of a compound is a shorthand tool used to provide basic information about the constitution of the compound in a concise and convenient manner. Mononuclear coordination entities contain a single central metal atom. The following rules are applied while writing the formulas: \n\n(i) The central atom is listed first.   \n(ii) The ligands are then listed in alphabetical order. The placement of a ligand in the list does not depend on its charge.   \n(ii) Polydentate ligands are also listed alphabetically. In case of abbreviated ligand, the first letter of the abbreviation is used to determine the position of the ligand in the alphabetical order.   \n(iv) The formula for the entire coordination entity, whether charged or not, is enclosed in square brackets. when ligands are polyatomic, their formulas are enclosed in parentheses. Ligand abbreviations are also enclosed in parentheses.   \n(v) There should be no space between the ligands and the metal within a coordination sphere.   \n(vi) when the formula of a charged coordination entity is to be written without that of the counter ion, the charge is indicated outside the square brackets as a right superscript with the number before the sign. For example, $\\mathrm { [ C o ( \\bar { C } N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ , $\\mathrm { [ C r ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 + } }$ ,etc.   \nvii) The charge of the cation(s) is balanced by the charge of the anion(s). \n\nThe names of coordination compounds are derived by following the principles of additive nomenclature. Thus, the groups that surround the central atom must be identified in the name. They are listed as prefixes to the name of the central atom along with any appropriate multipliers. The following rules are used when naming coordination compounds: \n\n(i) The cation is named first in both positively and negatively charged coordination entities.   \n(üi) The ligands are named in an alphabetical order before the name of the central atom/ion. (This procedure is reversed from writing formula).   \n(i) Names of the anionic ligands end in $^ { - 0 }$ , those of neutral and cationic ligands are the",

While writing the formula of coordination entity, these are enclosed in brackets ( ).   \n(iv) Prefixes mono, di, tri, etc., are used to indicate the number of the individual ligands in the coordination entity. when the names of the ligands include a numerical prefix, then the terms, bis, tris, tetrakis are used, the ligand to which they refer being placed in parentheses. For example, $\\mathrm { [ N i C l _ { 2 } ( P P h _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } ] }$ is named as dichloridobis(triphenylphosphine)nickel(II).   \n(v) Oxidation state of the metal in cation, anion or neutral coordination entity is indicated by Roman numeral in parenthesis.   \n(vi) If the complex ion is a cation, the metal is named same as the element. For example, Co in a complex cation is called cobalt and $\\mathrm { P t }$ is called platinum. If the complex ion is an anion, the name of the metal ends with the suffix – ate. For example, Co in a complex anion, $\\left[ \\mathrm { C o } \\left( \\mathrm { S C N } \\right) _ { 4 } \\right] ^ { 2 - }$ is called cobaltate. For some metals, the Latin names are used in the complex anions, e.g., ferrate for Fe. \n\n(vii) The neutral complex molecule is named similar to that of the complex cation. \n\nThe following examples illustrate the nomenclature for coordination compounds. \n\nNotice how the name of the metal differs in cation and anion even though they contain the same metal ions. \n\n1. $\\mathrm { [ C r ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 3 } ] C l _ { 3 } }$ is named as: triamminetriaquachromium(Il) chloride \n\nExplanation: The complex ion is inside the square bracket, which is a cation. The amine ligands are named before the aqua ligands according to alphabetical order. Since there are three chloride ions in the compound, the charge on the complex ion must be $+ 3$ (since the compound is electrically neutral). From the charge on the complex ion and the charge on the ligands, we can calculate the oxidation number of the metal. In this example, all the ligands are neutral molecules. Therefore, the oxidation number of chromium must be the same as the charge of the complex ion, $+ 3$ . \n\n2. $\\mathrm { [ C o ( H _ { 2 } N C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 2 } N H _ { 2 } ) _ { 3 } ] _ { 2 } ( S O _ { 4 } ) _ { 3 } }$ is named as: tris(ethane-1,2-diamine)cobalt(Il) sulphate \n\nExplanation: The sulphate is the counter anion in this molecule",

Each of which can be further subdivided. \n\n(a) Stereoisomerism \n\n(i) Geometrical isomerism (i) Optical isomerism \n\n(b) Structural isomerism \n\n(i) Linkage isomerism (ii) Coordination isomerism (ii) Ionisation isomerism (iv) Solvate isomerism \n\nStereoisomers have the same chemical formula and chemical bonds but they have different spatial arrangement. Structural isomers have different bonds. A detailed account of these isomers are given below. - \n\n5.4.1 Geometric Isomerism \n\nThis type of isomerism arises in heteroleptic complexes due to different possible geometric arrangements of the ligands. Important examples of this behaviour are found with coordination numbers 4 and 6. In a square planar complex of formula $\\mathrm { [ M X _ { 2 } L _ { 2 } ] }$ (X and L are unidentate), the two ligands X may be arranged adjacent to each other in a cis isomer, or opposite to each other in a trans isomer as depicted in Fig. 5.2. \n\nOther square planar complex of the type MABXL (where A, B, X, L are unidentates) shows three isomers-two cis and one trans. You may attempt to draw these structures. Such isomerism is not possible for a tetrahedral geometry but similar",

These are called as enantiomers. The molecules or ions that cannot be superimposed are called chiral.

A simple example is provided by complexes containing the thiocyanate ligand, NCS, which may bind through the nitrogen to give M-NCS or through sulphur to give M-SCN. Jorgensen discovered such behaviour in the complex $\\mathrm { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } ( N O _ { 2 } ) l C l _ { 2 } }$ which is obtained as the red form, in which the nitrite ligand is bound through oxygen (-ONO), and as the yellow form, in which the nitrite ligand is bound through nitrogen $\\left( - \\mathbf { N O } _ { 2 } \\right)$ . \n\n5.4.4 Coordination Isomerism \n\nThis type of isomerism arises from the interchange of ligands between cationic and anionic entities of different metal ions present in a complex.

But his theory could not answer basic questions like: \n\n(i) why only certain elements possess the remarkable property of forming coordination compounds?   \n(ii) why the bonds in coordination compounds have directional properties?   \n(ii) why coordination compounds have characteristic magnetic and optical properties? \n\nMany approaches have been put forth to explain the nature of bonding in coordination compounds viz.

The results can be used to obtain information about the number of unpaired electrons and hence structures adopted by metal complexes. \n\nA critical study of the magnetic data of coordination compounds of metals of the first transition series reveals some complications. For metal ions with upto three electrons in the $d$ orbitals, like $\\mathrm { T i } ^ { 3 + } ( d ^ { 1 } )$ ; ${ \\mathrm { V } } ^ { 3 + }$ $( d ^ { 2 } )$ ; $\\mathrm { C r } ^ { 3 + } \\ ( d ^ { 3 } )$ ; two vacant $d$ orbitals are available for octahedral hybridisation with $4 s$ and $4 p$ orbitals. The magnetic behaviour of these free ions and their coordination entities is similar. When more than three $3 d$ electrons are present, the required pair of $3 d$ orbitals for octahedral hybridisation is not directly available (as a consequence of Hund's rule). Thus, for $d ^ { 4 } ~ ( \\mathrm { C r ^ { 2 + } , ~ M n ^ { 3 + } } )$ , $d ^ { 5 }$ $( \\mathrm { M n ^ { 2 + } , \\ F e ^ { 3 + } } )$ , $d ^ { 6 }$ (cid:) $( \\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ , $\\mathrm { C o } ^ { 3 + } )$ cases, a vacant pair of $d$ orbitals results only by pairing of $3 d$ electrons which leaves two, one and zero unpaired electrons, respectively. \n\nThe magnetic data agree with maximum spin pairing in many cases, especially with coordination compounds containing $d ^ { \\widetilde { 6 } }$ ions.",

Ligands are treated as point charges in case of anions or point dipoles in case of neutral molecules. The five $d$ orbitals in an isolated gaseous metal atom/ion have same energy, i.e., they are degenerate. This degeneracy is maintained if a spherically symmetrical field of negative charges surrounds the metal atom/ion. However, when this negative field is due to ligands (either anions or the negative ends of dipolar molecules like $\\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }$ and $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } ]$ in a complex, it becomes asymmetrical and the degeneracy of the $d$ orbitals is lifted. It results in splitting of the $d$ orbitals. The pattern of splitting depends upon the nature of the crystal field. Let us explain this splitting in different crystal fields. \n\n(a) Crystal field splitting in octahedral coordination entities \n\nIn an octahedral coordination entity with six ligands surrounding the metal atom/ion, there will be repulsion between the electrons in metal $d$ orbitals and the electrons (or negative charges) of the ligands. Such a repulsion is more when the metal $d$ orbital is directed towards the ligand than when it is away from the ligand. Thus, the $d _ { \\mathrm { x ^ { 2 } - y ^ { 2 } } }$ (cid:) and $d _ { { } _ { z } { } ^ { 2 } }$ orbitals which point towards the axes along the direction of the ligand will experience more repulsion and will be raised in energy; and the $d _ { \\mathrm { x y } }$ , $d _ { \\mathrm { y z } }$ and $d _ { \\mathrm { x z } }$ orbitals which are directed between the axes will be lowered in energy relative to the average energy in the spherical crystal field. Thus, the degeneracy of the $d$ orbitals has been removed due to ligand electron-metal electron repulsions in the octahedral complex to yield three orbitals of lower energy, $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ set and two orbitals of higher energy, $e _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ set. This splitting of the \n\ndegenerate levels due to the presence of ligands in a definite geometry is termed as crystal field splitting and the energy separation is denoted by $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { o } }$ (the subscript o is for octahedral) (Fig.5.8). Thus, the energy of the two $e _ { \\mathrm { g",

Some ligands are able to produce strong fields in which case, the splitting will be large whereas others produce weak fields and consequently result in small splitting of $d$ orbitals. \n\nIn general, ligands can be arranged in a series in the order of increasing field strength as given below: \n\nSuch a series is termed as spectrochemical series. It is an experimentally determined series based on the absorption of light by complexes with different ligands. Let us assign electrons in the $d$ orbitals of metal ion in octahedral coordination entities. Obviously, the single $d$ electron occupies one of the lower energy $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ orbitals. In $d ^ { 2 }$ and $\\bar { \\boldsymbol { d } } ^ { 3 }$ coordination entities, the $d$ electrons occupy the $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ orbitals singly in accordance with the Hund's rule. For $d ^ { 4 }$ ions, two possible patterns of electron distribution arise: (i) the fourth electron could either enter the $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ level and pair with an existing electron, or (i) it could avoid paying the price of the pairing energy by occupying the $e _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ level. Which of these possibilities occurs, depends on the relative magnitude of the crystal field splitting, $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { o } }$ and the pairing energy, P (P represents the energy required for electron pairing in a single orbital). The two options are: \n\n(i) If $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { o } } < \\mathrm { P } ,$ , the fourth electron enters one of the $e _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ orbitals giving the   \nconfguration $t _ { \\mathrm { 2 g } } ^ { 3 } e _ { \\mathrm { g } } ^ { 1 } .$ Ligands for which are known as weak $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { o } } < \\mathrm { P }$ field ligands and form high spin complexes.   \n(i) If $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { o } } > \\mathrm { P } ,$ , it becomes more energetically favourable for the fourth electron to occupy a $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ orbital with configuration ${ t _ { \\mathrm { 2 g } } } ^ { 4 } { e _ { \\mathrm { g } } } ^ { 0 }$ . Ligands which produce this effect are known as strong field ligands and form low spin complexes. \n\nCalculations show that $d ^ { 4 }$ to $d ^ { 7 }$ coordination entities are more stable for strong field as compared to weak field cases.",

Ligands which produce this effect are known as strong field ligands and form low spin complexes. \n\nCalculations show that $d ^ { 4 }$ to $d ^ { 7 }$ coordination entities are more stable for strong field as compared to weak field cases. \n\nIn tetrahedral coordination entity formation, the $d$ orbital splitting (Fig. 5.9) is inverted and is smaller as compared to the octahedral field splitting. For the same metal, the same ligands and metal-ligand distances, it can be shown that $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { t } } = ( 4 / 9 )$ (cid:) $\\Delta _ { 0 }$ . Consequently, the orbital splitting energies are not sufficiently large for forcing pairing and, therefore, low spin configurations are rarely observed. The $\\cdot _ { \\mathrm { g } } ^ { \\mathrm { g } ^ { \\ast } }$ subscript is used for the octahedral and square planar complexes which have centre of symmetry. Since tetrahedral complexes lack symmetry, 'g' subscript is not used with energy levels. \n\n5.5.5 Colour in Coordination Compounds \n\nIn the previous Unit, we learnt that one of the most distinctive properties of transition metal complexes is their wide range of colours. This means that some of the visible spectrum is being removed from white light as it passes through the sample, so the light that emerges is no longer white. The colour of the complex is complementary to that which is absorbed. The complementary colour is the colour generated from the wavelength left over; if green light is absorbed by the complex, it appears red, Table 5.3 gives the relationship of the different wavelength absorbed and the colour observed. \n\nThe colour in the coordination compounds can be readily explained in terms of the crystal field theory. Consider, for example, the complex $\\mathrm { [ T i ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 + } }$ , which is violet in colour. This is an octahedral complex where the single electron $\\mathrm { ( T i ^ { 3 + } }$ is a $3 d ^ { 1 }$ system) in the metal $d$ orbital is in the $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ level in the ground state of the complex. The next higher state available for the electron is the empty $e _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ level. If light corresponding to the energy of blue-green region is absorbed by the complex, it would excite the electron from $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ level to the $e _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ $( { t _ { 2 } } _ { \\mathrm { g } } ^ { 1 } { { \\stackrel { \\bullet } { e _ { \\mathrm { g } } } } } ^ { 0 }  { t _ { 2 } } _ { \\mathrm { g } } ^ { 0 } { { e _ { \\mathrm { g } } } } ^ { 1 } )$ Consequently, the complex appears violet in colour (Fig. 5.10). The crystal field theory attributes the colour of the coordination compounds to $d \\ – d$ transition of the electron. \n\nIt is important to note that in the absence of ligand, crystal field splitting does not occur and hence the substance is colourless. For example, removal of water from $\\mathrm { [ T i ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 6 } ] C l _ {",

The influence of the ligand on the colour \n\nof a complex may be illustrated by considering the $\\mathrm { [ N i ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 2 + } }$ complex, which forms when nickel(Il) chloride is dissolved in water. If the didentate ligand, ethane-1,2-diamine(en) is progressively added in the molar ratios en:Ni, 1:1, 2: 1, 3: 1, the following series of reactions and their associated colour changes occur: \n\nThis sequence is shown in Fig. 5.11. \n\nColour of Some Gem Stones \n\nThe colours produced by electronic transitions within the $d$ orbitals of a transition metal ion occur frequently in everyday life. Ruby [Fig.5.12(a)】 is aluminium oxide $\\mathrm { ( A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } ) }$ containing about $0 . 5 – 1 \\%$ (cid:) $\\mathrm { C r } ^ { 3 + }$ ions $( d ^ { 3 } )$ , which are randomly distributed in positions normally occupied by ${ \\mathrm { A l } } ^ { 3 + }$ . We may view these chromium(Il) species as octahedral chromium(Il) complexes incorporated into the alumina lattice; $d { - } d$ transitions at these centres give rise to the colour. \n\nIn emerald [Fig.5.12(b)], $\\mathrm { C r } ^ { 3 + }$ ions occupy octahedral sites in the mineral beryl $\\mathrm { ( B e _ { 3 } A l _ { 2 } S i _ { 6 } O _ { 1 8 } ) }$ . The absorption bands seen in the ruby shift to longer wavelength, namely yellow-red and blue, causing emerald to transmit light in the green region. \n\n5.5.6 Limitations of Crystal Field Theory \n\nThe crystal field model is successful in explaining the formation, structures, colour and magnetic properties of coordination compounds to a large extent. However, from the assumptions that the ligands are point charges, it follows that anionic ligands should exert the greatest splitting effect. The anionic ligands actually are found at the low end of the spectrochemical series. Further, it does not take into account the covalent character of bonding between the ligand and the central atom. These are some of the weaknesses of CFT, which are explained by ligand field theory (LFT) and molecular orbital theory which are beyond the scope of the present study. \n\nIntext Questions \n\n5.5 Explain on the basis of valence bond theory that $\\mathrm { [ N i ( C N ) _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 - } }$ ion with square planar structure is diamagnetic and the $\\mathrm { [ N i C l _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 - } }$ ion with tetrahedral geometry is paramagnetic.   \n5.6 $\\mathrm { [ N i",

These carbonyls have simple, well defined structures. Tetracarbonylnickel(O) is tetrahedral, pentacarbonyliron(O) is trigonalbipyramidal while hexacarbonyl chromium(O) is octahedral. \n\nDecacarbonyldimanganese(O) is made up of two square pyramidal $\\mathbf { M n } ( \\mathbf { C O } ) _ { 5 }$ units joined by a Mn – Mn bond. Octacarbonyldicobalt(O) has a Co – Co bond bridged by two CO groups (Fig.5.13). \n\nThe metal-carbon bond in metal carbonyls possess both $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ character. The $\\mathbf { M } { - } \\mathbf { C } \\mathbf { \\Lambda } \\sigma$ bond is formed by the donation of lone pair of electrons on the carbonyl carbon into a vacant orbital of the metal. The M-C $\\pi$ bond is formed by the donation of a pair of electrons from a filled $d$ orbital of metal into the vacant antibonding $\\pi ^ { * }$ orbital of carbon monoxide. The metal to ligand bonding creates a synergic effect which strengthens the bond between CO and the metal (Fig.5.14). \n\n5.7 Importance and Applications of Coordination Compounds \n\nThe coordination compounds are of great importance.

Examples of such reagents include EDTA, DMG - (dimethylglyoxime), $\\alpha$ -nitroso- $\\cdot \\mathrm { \\{ \\} }$ —naphthol, cupron, etc. Hardness of water is estimated by simple titration with $\\mathrm { N a _ { 2 } E D T A }$ The $\\mathrm { { C a } ^ { 2 + } }$ and $\\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ ions form stable complexes with EDTA. The selective estimation of these ions can be done due to difference in the stability constants of calcium and magnesium complexes. Some important extraction processes of metals, like those of silver and gold, make use of complex formation. Gold, for example, combines with cyanide in the presence of oxygen and water to form the coordination entity $[ \\mathrm { A u ( C N ) _ { 2 } } ] ^ { - }$ in aqueous solution. Gold can be separated in metallic form from this solution by the addition of zinc. Similarly, purification of metals can be achieved through formation and subsequent decomposition of their coordination compounds. \n\nFor example, impure nickel is converted to $\\mathrm { [ N i ( C O ) _ { 4 } ] }$ , which is decomposed to yield pure nickel. \n\nCoordination compounds are of great importance in biological systems.

Haemoglobin, the red pigment of blood which acts as oxygen carrier is a coordination compound of iron. Vitamin $\\mathrm { { B } } _ { 1 2 }$ , cyanocobalamine, the antipernicious anaemia factor, is a coordination compound of cobalt. Among the other compounds of biological importance with coordinated metal ions are the enzymes like, carboxypeptidase A and carbonic anhydrase (catalysts of biological systems).   \n● Coordination compounds are used as catalysts for many industrial processes.

Thus, excess of copper and iron are removed by the chelating ligands D-penicillamine and desferrioxime B via the formation of coordination compounds. EDTA is used in the treatment of lead poisoning. Some coordination compounds of platinum effectively inhibit the growth of tumours. Examples are: cis-platin and related compounds. \n\nSummary \n\nThe chemistry of coordination compounds is an important and challenging area of modern inorganic chemistry. During the last fifty years, advances in this area, have provided development of new concepts and models of bonding and molecular structure, novel breakthroughs in chemical industry and vital insights into the functioning of critical components of biological systems. \n\nThe first systematic attempt at explaining the formation, reactions, structure and bonding of a coordination compound was made by A. werner. His theory postulated the use of two types of linkages (primary and secondary) by a metal atom/ion in a coordination compound. In the modern language of chemistry these linkages are recognised as the ionisable (ionic) and non-ionisable (covalent) bonds, respectively. Using the property of isomerism, Werner predicted the geometrical shapes of a large number of coordination entities. \n\nThe Valence Bond Theory (vBT) explains with reasonable success, the formation, magnetic behaviour and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds. It, however, fails to provide a quantitative interpretation of magnetic behaviour and has nothing to say about the optical properties of these compounds. \n\nThe Crystal Field Theory (CFT) to coordination compounds is based on the effect of different crystal fields (provided by the ligands taken as point charges), on the degeneracy of $d$ orbital energies of the central metal atom/ion. The splitting of the $d$ orbitals provides different electronic arrangements in strong and weak crystal fields. The treatment provides for quantitative estimations of orbital separation energies, magnetic moments and spectral and stability parameters. However, the assumption that ligands consititute point charges creates many theoretical difficulties. \n\nThe metal-carbon bond in metal carbonyls possesses both $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ character. The ligand to metal is $\\sigma$ bond and metal to ligand is $\\pi$ bond. This unique synergic bonding provides stability to metal carbonyls. \n\nCoordination compounds are of great importance. These compounds provide critical insights into the functioning and structures of vital components of biological systems. Coordination compounds also find extensive applications in metallurgical processes, analytical and medicinal chemistry. \n\nExercises \n\n5.1 Explain the bonding in coordination compounds in terms of Werner's postulates. \n\n5.2 (cid:) $\\mathrm { F e S O _ { 4 } }$ solution mixed with $\\mathrm { ( N H _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } S O _ { 4 } }$ solution in 1:1 molar ratio gives the test of $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ ion but $\\mathrm { C u S O _ { 4 } }$ solution mixed with aqueous ammonia in 1:4 molar ratio does not give the test of $\\mathrm { { C u } ^ { 2 + } }$ ion.

The layout centers around a large, three-dimensional polyhedral shape representing the coordination polyhedron, specifically an octahedron, which is a common geometry for coordination compounds. At the center of the polyhedron is a large blue sphere symbolizing the central metal ion, likely cobalt (Co), given the context. Surrounding the central ion are six smaller spheres arranged symmetrically at the vertices of the octahedron, representing ligands bound to the metal ion. These ligands are depicted in two distinct colors: four are purple spheres, and two are green spheres, indicating different types of ligands such as ammonia molecules (NH3) and chloride ions (Cl-), consistent with the examples in the surrounding text. Lines or sticks connect the central metal ion to each ligand, illustrating coordinate covalent bonds. The image uses a clean, schematic style with solid colors and clear geometric shapes to emphasize spatial arrangement and bonding. The background is white, ensuring high contrast and focus on the molecular structure. No text or labels are directly on the image, but the visual elements correspond closely to the coordination entities and polyhedra discussed in the surrounding content, such as the octahedral geometry of complexes like [Co(NH3)6]3+ and mixed ligand complexes like [CoCl2(NH3)4]+. The image effectively visualizes the concept of coordination number (six) and the spatial arrangement of ligands around a central metal ion, reinforcing Werner's postulates about primary and secondary valences and the fixed coordination number. The technical style is typical of inorganic chemistry educational materials, aiding in understanding the three-dimensional nature of coordination compounds.",

It presents four coordination compounds of cobalt(III) chloride with varying numbers of ammonia and chloride ligands, each identified by a distinct colour (Yellow, Purple, Green, Violet). The formulas indicate the coordination entities with ligands inside square brackets and counter ions outside, reflecting Werner's theory of coordination compounds. The solution conductivity column classifies each complex as a 1:3, 1:2, or 1:1 electrolyte, corresponding to the number of ions produced upon dissolution. Key patterns include the decrease in free chloride ions from Yellow (3Cl-) to Violet (1Cl-), demonstrating the concept of primary and secondary valences where chloride ions inside the coordination sphere are non-ionizable (secondary valence) and those outside are ionizable (primary valence). The Yellow complex [Co(NH3)6]3+3Cl- shows the highest electrolyte ratio (1:3), indicating all chlorides are outside the coordination sphere, while the Green and Violet complexes have identical empirical formulas but differ in colour and conductivity, illustrating isomerism. This table supports the surrounding content by providing experimental evidence for Werner's postulates, especially the distinction between primary and secondary valences, coordination number fixed at six, and the existence of isomers with identical formulas but different properties. It concretely illustrates how coordination compounds maintain a fixed number of ligands bound to the metal ion and how the nature and number of counter ions affect solution conductivity, reinforcing the theoretical concepts discussed in the text about coordination chemistry and complex ion formation.",

The compounds include PdCl2.4NH3, NiCl2.6H2O, PtCl4.2HCl, CoCl3.4NH3, and PtCl2.2NH3. The moles of AgCl precipitated vary from 0 to 2, reflecting the number of chloride ions available to react with AgNO3. For example, PdCl2.4NH3 and NiCl2.6H2O each precipitate 2 moles of AgCl, indicating two free chloride ions, while PtCl4.2HCl precipitates none, suggesting all chloride ions are coordinated and unavailable. CoCl3.4NH3 shows an anomalous value '1 0' likely a typographical error, presumably meaning 1 mole of AgCl. PtCl2.2NH3 lacks data. This pattern aligns with Werner's coordination theory, where chloride ions bound as primary valences are ionizable and precipitate AgCl, while those bound as secondary valences remain coordinated and do not precipitate. The table supports the concept of primary and secondary valences and the identification of coordination numbers by quantifying free chloride ions. It also illustrates the difference in ligand binding and ionization among various coordination compounds, reinforcing Werner's postulates about coordination chemistry and the behavior of complex ions in solution.",

The central atom is depicted as a large blue sphere labeled 'Co' (cobalt), positioned at the center of the composition. Surrounding the cobalt ion are six smaller spheres representing ligands, arranged octahedrally around the central atom, consistent with a coordination number of six. Three of these ligands are ammonia molecules (NH3), each shown as a small cluster of white and blue spheres representing hydrogen and nitrogen atoms respectively, connected to the cobalt ion by straight lines indicating coordinate bonds. The other three ligands are chloride ions (Cl-), represented as green spheres, also bonded to the cobalt center. The bonds are depicted as solid lines radiating symmetrically from the cobalt ion to each ligand, emphasizing the octahedral geometry. The background is plain white, ensuring clear visibility of the molecular structure. The color scheme uses conventional chemical coloring: blue for nitrogen, white for hydrogen, green for chlorine, and blue for cobalt, aiding in quick identification of elements. The image is a clean, schematic representation typical of inorganic chemistry textbooks, designed to visually explain the concept of coordination entities and coordination numbers. This visual directly relates to the surrounding text discussing coordination compounds, specifically the example of [CoCl3(NH3)3], illustrating the concept of a central metal ion bonded to ligands in a defined geometrical arrangement. The image supports the explanation of coordination entities, central atoms, ligands, and coordination numbers by providing a concrete example of these abstract concepts. No additional text or annotations are present in the image, focusing solely on the molecular structure. The lighting is uniform and shadowless, typical of digital chemical diagrams, ensuring clarity and focus on the molecular geometry without distractions.",

The layout is horizontal, displaying three distinct geometric shapes side by side, each representing a different coordination environment around a central metal atom or ion (denoted as 'M'). Each polyhedron is composed of a central sphere labeled 'M' surrounded symmetrically by smaller spheres labeled 'L', which represent unidentate ligands. The first shape on the left is an octahedral geometry, showing six ligands arranged at the vertices of an octahedron around the central metal atom. The middle shape depicts a tetrahedral geometry with four ligands positioned at the corners of a tetrahedron. The third shape on the right illustrates a square planar geometry, where four ligands are arranged in a square plane around the central atom. The ligands are uniformly colored in a light shade, contrasting with the central metal atom, which is depicted in a darker color to emphasize its central role. The image uses simple, clean lines and spheres to convey the spatial arrangement without additional textures or shading, focusing on clarity and educational value. The background is plain white, ensuring no distraction from the geometric forms. The caption below the image explicitly states that 'M' represents the central atom or ion and 'L' a unidentate ligand, linking the visual elements directly to the chemical concepts discussed in the surrounding text. This image visually supports the textual explanation of coordination polyhedra by providing concrete examples of octahedral, tetrahedral, and square planar geometries, which are critical for understanding the spatial arrangement of ligands around a central metal ion in coordination compounds.",

The layout consists of two distinct molecular diagrams side by side, each representing one of the two possible isomers: cis and trans. Both diagrams depict a central platinum (Pt) atom coordinated to two amine (NH2) ligands and two chloride (Cl) ligands arranged in a square planar geometry. In the cis isomer on the left, the two chloride ligands are adjacent to each other, positioned next to one another at 90-degree angles around the platinum center, while the two amine ligands occupy the remaining adjacent positions. In contrast, the trans isomer on the right shows the two chloride ligands positioned opposite each other at 180 degrees, with the amine ligands also opposite each other. The ligands are represented by labeled spheres or circles, with 'NH2' and 'Cl' clearly marked, and the platinum center is centrally located. The color scheme uses distinct colors to differentiate the ligands: typically, the platinum center is shown in a metallic gray or silver tone, the chloride ligands in green, and the amine ligands in blue or white, consistent with common chemical diagram conventions. The background is plain white, ensuring high contrast and clarity. The image is captioned as 'Fig. 5.2: Geometrical isomers (cis and trans) of Pt [NH2Cl]2', linking it directly to the surrounding text discussing geometric isomerism in square planar complexes. The visual style is schematic and educational, designed to clearly convey the spatial arrangement differences between the cis and trans isomers without extraneous detail.

Each model depicts an octahedral cobalt(III) complex with six ligands arranged around a central cobalt atom. The left model represents the facial isomer, where three identical nitrite (NO2) ligands occupy adjacent positions at the corners of one octahedral face, forming a triangular arrangement. The three ammonia (NH3) ligands occupy the remaining three positions, also adjacent to each other. The right model shows the meridional isomer, where the three nitrite ligands are arranged in a plane passing through the central cobalt atom, spanning a meridian of the octahedron, with the ammonia ligands occupying the other three positions. The cobalt atom is centrally located and typically represented by a larger sphere, while the ligands are smaller spheres or groups connected by bonds. The nitrite ligands are visually distinct from the ammonia ligands, likely differentiated by color or shape to emphasize their positions.

The ligands are shown as pairs of nitrogen atoms connected by ethylene bridges, forming chelate rings with the cobalt center. The left model represents the dextrorotatory (d) enantiomer, and the right model represents the levorotatory (l) enantiomer, which are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. The cobalt ion is typically shown as a central sphere, often in a distinct color such as pink or purple, while the nitrogen atoms and carbon backbones of the ligands are rendered in different colors (commonly blue for nitrogen and gray or white for carbon and hydrogen) to distinguish atomic types. The spatial arrangement emphasizes the chiral nature of the complex, with the ligands arranged in a helical fashion around the cobalt center, demonstrating the concept of optical isomerism in octahedral coordination compounds. The lighting is uniform and bright, highlighting the three-dimensional geometry and the symmetry differences between the two isomers. This visual directly supports the surrounding text on optical isomerism in coordination chemistry, providing a clear, concrete example of enantiomers in octahedral complexes with bidentate ligands.",

The layout features two three-dimensional molecular structures side by side, each representing one of the optical isomers labeled as 'd' (dextro) and 'l' (laevo). Each structure shows a central platinum (Pt) atom coordinated in an octahedral geometry with two chloride (Cl) ligands and two ethane-1,2-diamine (en) ligands. The ethane-1,2-diamine ligands are depicted as bidentate, forming chelate rings with the platinum center. The two isomers are mirror images that cannot be superimposed, demonstrating chirality. The 'd' isomer is shown with a specific spatial arrangement of ligands that rotates plane-polarized light to the right, while the 'l' isomer has the opposite arrangement, rotating light to the left. The color scheme uses standard chemical conventions: platinum is represented by a central gray or metallic sphere, chlorine atoms are green, nitrogen atoms in the amine groups are blue, carbon atoms are black or dark gray, and hydrogen atoms are white or omitted for clarity. The lighting and shading emphasize the three-dimensionality of the molecules, with clear bonds and angles illustrating the octahedral coordination environment. The image is consistent with the surrounding textbook content on optical isomerism in coordination chemistry, specifically referencing the example of cis-[PtCl2(en)2]2+ as an optically active complex. The caption 'Fig.5.7 Optical isomers (d and l) of cis[PtCl2(en)2]2+ (cid:)' directly links the visual to the textual explanation of optical isomerism, reinforcing the concept of chirality in octahedral complexes with bidentate ligands.",

It categorizes coordination complexes based on their coordination number (4, 5, or 6) and associates each with specific hybridisation types and corresponding spatial geometries. For coordination number 4, two hybridisation types are listed: 'sp3' corresponding to a tetrahedral geometry, and 'dsp2' corresponding to a square planar geometry. For coordination number 5, the hybridisation is 'sp3d' (noted as 'sp{d' in the table, likely a typographical error) with a trigonal bipyramidal geometry. For coordination number 6, two hybridisation types are given: 'sp3d2' and 'd2sp3' (noted as 'sp{d2' and 'dp3' respectively), both corresponding to octahedral geometry. This reflects the common hybridisation schemes used to explain the shapes of coordination complexes in Valence Bond Theory (VBT). The table highlights the relationship between the number of ligands coordinated to the metal center and the hybrid orbitals formed, which determine the geometry of the complex. The presence of multiple hybridisation types for the same coordination number (e.g., 4 and 6) illustrates the diversity of possible geometries and electronic configurations, such as low spin (inner orbital) and high spin (outer orbital) complexes. This supports the surrounding content's discussion on VBT and the prediction of complex geometries and magnetic properties based on hybridisation. The table concretely links coordination number, hybridisation type, and spatial arrangement, reinforcing the theoretical concepts introduced in the text about bonding and structure in coordination compounds.",

The chromium ion is represented by a central purple sphere, and the water molecules are depicted as smaller red and white spheres indicating oxygen and hydrogen atoms respectively. The complex is shown with three chloride ions (Cl-) outside the coordination sphere, represented by green spheres, indicating they are free ions in the crystal lattice. On the right side, the image shows the solvate isomer [Cr(H2O)5Cl]Cl2·H2O, which is grey-green in color. This complex features a chromium ion at the center coordinated to five water molecules and one chloride ion directly bonded to the metal, depicted by a green sphere within the coordination sphere. Two chloride ions are shown outside the coordination sphere, and an additional water molecule is present as a free solvent molecule in the lattice, indicated separately. The image uses color coding to differentiate between ligands and ions: purple for chromium, red and white for water molecules, and green for chloride ions. The lighting and shading give a three-dimensional effect to the spheres, enhancing the clarity of spatial arrangement. The visual style is schematic and scientific, aimed at clearly conveying the difference in ligand coordination between the two isomers. The image directly relates to the surrounding text on solvate isomerism by providing a concrete example of how solvent molecules can either be coordinated to the metal ion or exist as free molecules in the crystal lattice, thus illustrating the concept of hydrate isomerism.

The layout is divided into two main parts, each depicting a different solvate isomer of chromium chloride complexes. On the left side, the complex [Cr(H2O)6]Cl3 is shown, characterized by a violet color, indicating the presence of six water molecules directly bonded to the chromium ion. The chromium ion is centrally located, surrounded octahedrally by six water ligands, represented by red and white spheres (oxygen and hydrogen atoms respectively). Three chloride ions (Cl-) are shown outside the coordination sphere as free ions, depicted as green spheres, indicating they are not bonded directly to the chromium ion but present in the crystal lattice. On the right side, the solvate isomer [Cr(H2O)5Cl]Cl2·H2O is illustrated, with a grey-green color tone. Here, five water molecules and one chloride ion are directly bonded to the chromium ion, forming the coordination sphere. Two chloride ions remain outside the coordination sphere as free ions. Additionally, a water molecule is shown outside the coordination sphere, representing the solvent molecule present in the crystal lattice but not bonded to the metal ion. The chromium ion is centrally placed with ligands arranged octahedrally. The image uses color coding to differentiate atoms: chromium is shown in a metallic or grey tone, oxygen in red, hydrogen in white, and chlorine in green. The lighting is neutral, with clear, sharp lines and a realistic ball-and-stick molecular model style. The image visually supports the textual explanation of solvate isomerism by contrasting the bonding of solvent molecules either inside or outside the coordination sphere, highlighting the difference in chemical composition and color between the two isomers. This visual aid helps in understanding the subtle structural differences that define solvate isomers in coordination chemistry.",

The layout centers on the electronic configuration and hybrid orbitals of the Ni2+ ion. At the top left, the 3d orbitals are depicted with electron spins indicated by arrows, showing the distribution of electrons in the d subshell. Adjacent to this, the 4s and 4p orbitals are shown, also with electron spin notations. Below these, the hybridisation scheme is represented, combining one s orbital and three p orbitals to form four equivalent sp3 hybrid orbitals arranged tetrahedrally. Each of these hybrid orbitals is shown receiving a pair of electrons donated by chloride ions (Cl-), represented by electron pairs entering the hybrid orbitals. The diagram uses black and white line art with clear labels for orbitals and electron spins, emphasizing the paramagnetic nature of the complex due to the presence of two unpaired electrons in the 3d orbitals.

The layout is a vertical energy diagram with orbitals arranged along an energy axis. At the top, a single horizontal line labeled 'd orbitals in free ion' shows five degenerate orbitals at the same energy level, depicted as five equally spaced horizontal lines grouped together. Below this, the diagram splits into two sets of orbitals: the higher energy 'e_g' set and the lower energy 't_2g' set. The 'e_g' set consists of two orbitals, specifically the d_(x^2-y^2) and d_(z^2) orbitals, shown as two horizontal lines raised above the baseline, indicating increased energy due to direct interaction with ligands along the axes. The 't_2g' set consists of three orbitals, d_(xy), d_(yz), and d_(xz), shown as three horizontal lines lowered below the baseline, indicating decreased energy as these orbitals point between the ligand axes and experience less repulsion. The energy difference between the 't_2g' and 'e_g' levels is denoted by the symbol Δ_o (octahedral crystal field splitting energy), with an arrow indicating the magnitude of this splitting. The diagram uses clear labels for each orbital and energy level, with the energy axis oriented vertically to emphasize the relative energy changes. The color scheme is simple, using black lines and text on a white background, consistent with typical textbook style for clarity. The image directly relates to the surrounding text on page 13, which explains the concept of crystal field splitting in octahedral complexes, the effect of ligand field strength on splitting, and the resulting electronic configurations. This visual aids in understanding how the degeneracy of d orbitals is lifted in an octahedral environment, a fundamental concept in crystal field theory and coordination chemistry.",

Mathematically, it is an inequality chain comparing ligand field strengths: I^- < Br^- < SCN^- < Cl^- < S^{2-} < F^- < OH^- < C_2O_4^{2-} < H_2O < NCS^- < EDTA^{4-} < NH_3 < en < CN^- < CO. Each ligand is treated as an entity producing a crystal field splitting energy (Δ), and the inequality indicates increasing Δ values from left to right. Variables represent ligands with their respective charges and denticity (e.g., en = ethylenediamine, a bidentate ligand; EDTA^{4-} = hexadentate ligand). The mathematical operation is a strict inequality chain, expressing an order relation on ligand field strengths. This series is fundamental in crystal field theory (CFT), which models the splitting of degenerate d orbitals in transition metal complexes due to electrostatic interactions with ligands. The physical significance lies in predicting electronic configurations, magnetic properties, and colors of coordination compounds. Strong field ligands (right side) cause large Δ, favoring low-spin states, while weak field ligands (left side) cause small Δ, favoring high-spin states. This ordering is crucial for understanding the electronic structure, stability, and reactivity of coordination complexes, and it relates directly to the discussion on crystal field splitting energies (Δ_o and Δ_t), spin states, and magnetic moments. Practically, it guides chemists in ligand selection for desired complex properties in catalysis, material science, and bioinorganic chemistry. The equation integrates into the broader framework by quantifying ligand effects on d orbital splitting, complementing the qualitative VB theory limitations and supporting CFT's electrostatic model.",

The layout is vertically oriented, showing energy levels with corresponding orbital labels. At the top, there is a label indicating the higher energy set of orbitals, labeled as 'e' orbitals, and below it, a lower energy set labeled as 't2' orbitals. The diagram uses horizontal lines to represent the energy levels of these orbitals, with the 'e' orbitals positioned higher than the 't2' orbitals, indicating the inversion of splitting compared to the octahedral field. The energy difference between these two sets is denoted by the symbol Δt, representing the tetrahedral crystal field splitting energy. The diagram is simple, using black lines and text on a white background, with no additional colors or shading. The visual style is schematic and technical, typical for educational chemistry texts. This image directly relates to the surrounding content on page 14, which discusses the differences in crystal field splitting between octahedral and tetrahedral complexes, emphasizing that Δt is smaller and inverted relative to Δo (octahedral splitting). The image supports the explanation that tetrahedral complexes generally do not exhibit low spin configurations due to the smaller splitting energy. The diagram is a clear, concise visual aid to understand the concept of d orbital splitting in tetrahedral fields, complementing the theoretical discussion in the text.",

The first column lists various coordination complexes primarily of cobalt and copper with different ligands such as NH3, H2O, and CN-. The second column provides specific wavelengths of light absorbed by these complexes, ranging from 475 nm to 535 nm, which correspond to visible light spectrum regions. The third column identifies the colour of the light absorbed, including yellow, blue, green, and blue again, with one entry indicating absorption outside the visible spectrum. The fourth column shows the resulting colour of the coordination entity, which is complementary to the absorbed light: violet, red, yellow, orange, and pale yellow respectively. Key patterns include the direct relationship between the wavelength absorbed and the complementary colour observed, illustrating the principle that the colour of coordination compounds arises from d-d electronic transitions influenced by ligand field effects. For example, the complex [CoCl(NH3)5]2+ absorbs yellow light at 535 nm and appears violet, while [Co(NH3)6]3+ absorbs green light at 475 nm and appears yellow. The data supports the surrounding content's explanation of crystal field splitting and its impact on the electronic transitions responsible for the colour of coordination compounds. It also exemplifies how different ligands affect the crystal field strength, altering the absorption wavelength and thus the observed colour. This table concretely illustrates the spectrochemical series concept and the role of ligand field strength in determining the optical properties of coordination complexes.",

The composition is arranged horizontally, showing five distinct test tubes or solution containers filled with aqueous solutions. Each container corresponds to a different molar ratio of en to Ni: 0:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and possibly a control or initial state. The solutions exhibit a gradient of colors ranging from pale greenish or blue-green on the left (nickel(II) aqua complex) to deeper blue shades on the right, indicating the formation of different nickel(II) complexes with increasing en ligand coordination. The background is neutral, likely white or light gray, to emphasize the vividness of the solution colors. The lighting is even and bright, enhancing the visibility of subtle color differences. The image visually supports the surrounding text's explanation of ligand substitution reactions and their effect on the color of coordination compounds, illustrating the spectrochemical impact of ethane-1,2-diamine ligands replacing water molecules in the nickel(II) coordination sphere. No additional text or labels are visible within the image itself, but the caption clearly identifies the chemical context. The image is a photographic or high-quality digital photo style, focusing on clarity and accurate color reproduction to aid in understanding the chemical phenomena described in the text.",

The left panel, labeled (a), shows a ruby gemstone, described as originating from marble deposits in Mogok, Myanmar. The ruby is a deep, vivid red color, characteristic of chromium(III) ion impurities in aluminum oxide (Al2O3). The gemstone appears polished with a smooth, glossy surface reflecting light, highlighting its rich red hue and internal clarity. The right panel, labeled (b), displays an emerald gemstone sourced from Muzo, Colombia. The emerald exhibits a vibrant green color, attributed to chromium(III) ions substituting in the beryl mineral lattice (Be3Al2Si6O18). The emerald's surface is also polished and glossy, with visible internal inclusions typical of natural emeralds, and the lighting emphasizes its translucent green coloration. Both gemstones are presented against a neutral, dark background that enhances their colors and reflective qualities. The image visually supports the surrounding text discussing the origin of gemstone colors from d-d electronic transitions in transition metal ions within crystal lattices, specifically chromium(III) in ruby and emerald.

The layout is organized to display multiple distinct metal carbonyl species, each labeled and depicted with clear atomic and bonding representations. The central metals shown include nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and cobalt (Co), each coordinated exclusively by carbonyl (CO) ligands. The structures include tetrahedral tetracarbonylnickel(0), trigonal bipyramidal pentacarbonyliron(0), octahedral hexacarbonylchromium(0), square pyramidal decacarbonyldimanganese(0) composed of two Mn(CO)5 units linked by a Mn–Mn bond, and octacarbonyldicobalt(0) featuring a Co–Co bond bridged by two CO groups. The carbon atoms of the CO ligands are connected to the metal centers via sigma bonds, and the illustrations emphasize the metal-metal bonding where applicable. The color scheme uses metallic gray or silver tones for the metal atoms and red and black for the oxygen and carbon atoms of the CO ligands, respectively, highlighting the ligand environment. The lighting and shading effects provide a three-dimensional perspective to the molecular geometries, enhancing the clarity of spatial arrangements. The image visually supports the surrounding text on page 17, which discusses the bonding characteristics of metal carbonyls, including the synergic sigma donation and pi back-donation between metal d orbitals and CO ligands, as well as the significance of metal-metal bonds in multinuclear complexes. This visual aid complements the theoretical explanations by providing concrete structural examples of coordination compounds, reinforcing the concepts of geometry, bonding, and electronic interactions in metal carbonyl chemistry.",

The composition centers on a schematic molecular diagram illustrating the synergic bonding mechanism. The metal atom is depicted at the center, with arrows indicating electron donation and back-donation pathways. One arrow shows the donation of a lone pair of electrons from the carbon atom of the CO ligand into an empty orbital of the metal, representing the sigma (σ) bond. Another arrow points from a filled d orbital of the metal back to the antibonding π* orbital of the CO ligand, illustrating the pi (π) back-donation. The diagram uses color coding to differentiate orbitals and electron flow, typically with blue or black arrows for electron donation and red or green for back-donation, enhancing clarity. The background is plain, focusing attention on the molecular orbitals and bonding interactions. The image is technical, designed to complement the surrounding text explaining the nature of metal-carbon bonds in carbonyl complexes, emphasizing the synergic effect that strengthens the metal-CO bond.

Mathematically, these are chemical formulas denoting coordination complexes, where the central metal ion is surrounded by ligands forming coordinate covalent bonds. The variables are the chemical symbols and subscripts indicating the number and type of ligands: for example, (CN)_6^{4-} denotes a hexacyanoferrate(II) ion with six cyanide ligands and a net charge of -4. The notation uses superscripts to indicate the overall charge of the complex ion. The equation lists four distinct coordination complexes: (i) [Fe(CN)_6]^{4-}, (ii) [FeF_6]^{3-}, (iii) [Co(C_2O_4)_3]^{3-}, and (iv) [CoF_6]^{3-}. These complexes illustrate different ligand types (cyanide, fluoride, oxalate) and metal centers (Fe, Co) with varying oxidation states and coordination geometries. The mathematical operations involved are primarily symbolic representation of chemical composition and charge balance, rather than algebraic manipulation. In the context of coordination chemistry, these complexes exemplify the principles of ligand field theory, coordination number, and charge distribution. Physically, they represent species with distinct electronic structures, magnetic properties, and colors, relevant to spectrochemical series and crystal field splitting. The equation relates to the broader discussion on coordination compounds, their bonding, isomerism, and properties, serving as examples for exercises on oxidation states, ligand types, and coordination geometry. Practically, such complexes are important in analytical chemistry, catalysis, and bioinorganic chemistry, illustrating how ligand environment influences metal center behavior.",

For such calculations, logarithms are very useful. They help us in making difficult calculations easy. In Chemistry, logarithm values are required in solving problems of chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, etc. We shallfirst introduce this concept, and discuss the laws, which will have to be followed in working with logarithms, and then apply this technique to a number of problems to show how it makes difficult calculations simple. \n\nWe know that   \n$2 ^ { 3 } = 8$ , $3 ^ { 2 } = 9$ , $5 ^ { 3 } = 1 2 5$ ,id $7 ^ { 0 } = 1$   \nIn general, for a positive real number a, and a rational number m, let ${ \\mathrm {  ~ a ~ } } ^ { \\mathrm { \\tiny { m } } } = { \\mathrm {  ~ b ~ } }$ , where b is a real number. In other words   \nthe $\\mathrm { m } ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ power of base a is b.   \nAnother way of stating the same fact is   \nlogarithm of b to base a is m.   \nIf for a positive real number a, $\\mathrm { ~ a ~ } \\neq 1$ blis ${ \\bf a } ^ { \\mathrm { m } } = { \\bf b }$ ,   \nwe say that m is the logarithm of b to the base a. \n\nwe write this as loga $\\log _ { \\mathrm { ~ a ~ } } ^ { \\mathrm { ~ b ~ } } = \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ , \"log\" being the abbreviation of the word \"logarithm\". Thus, we have \n\nLaws of Logarithms \n\nIn the follwing discussion, we shall take logarithms to any base a, $\\mathrm { ~ \\normalfont ~ \\left( a ~ \\right) ~ } ^ { } 0$ and a $\\neq 1$ \n\nFirst Law: $\\mathrm { l o g _ { a } \\ ( m n ) \\ = \\ l o g _ { a } m \\ + \\ l o g _ { a } n }$   \nProof: Suppose that $\\log _ { \\mathrm { a } } \\mathbf { m } = \\mathbf { x }$ and $\\mathrm { 1 o g _ { a } n = y }$   \nThen $\\mathrm { a ^ { x } = m }$ , $\\mathbf { a } ^ { \\mathrm { y } } = \\mathbf { n }$ (cid:)   \nHence $\\mathrm { { m n } = \\mathrm { { a } ^ { x } . \\mathrm { { a } ^ { y } = \\mathrm { { a } ^ { x + y } } } } }$   \nIt now follows from the definition of logarithms that   \n$\\mathrm { \\ l o g _ { a } \\ ( m n ) \\ : = \\ x + \\ y = \\ l o g _ { a } \\ m - \\ l o g _ { a } \\ n }$ (cid:) \n\nSecond Law: $\\log _ { \\mathrm { a } } { \\left( \\frac { \\mathrm { m } } { \\mathrm { n } } \\right) } = \\log _ { \\mathrm { a } } \\mathrm { ~ m ~ - ~ } \\log _ {",

Similarly, the Second Law says: the log of the ratio of two numbers is the diference of their logs. Thus, the use of these laws converts a problem of multiplication/division into a problem of addition/subtraction, which are far easier to perform than multiplication/division. That is why logarithms are so useful in all numerical computations. \n\nLogarithms to Base 10 \n\nBecause number 10 is the base of writing numbers, it is very convenient to use logarithms to the base 10. Some examples are: \n\n$\\log _ { 1 0 } 1 0 \\ = \\ 1 .$ ,d since $1 0 ^ { 1 } = 1 0$ $\\log _ { 1 0 } 1 0 0 = 2 ,$ (cid:) since $1 0 ^ { 2 } = 1 0 0$ (cid:) $\\log _ { 1 0 } 1 0 0 0 0 = 4$ ,d since $1 0 ^ { 4 } = 1 0 0 0 0$ $\\log _ { 1 0 } 0 . 0 1 = - 2$ ,d since $1 0 ^ { - 2 } = 0 . 0 1$ (id $\\log _ { 1 0 } { 0 . 0 0 1 } = - 3 ,$ since $1 0 ^ { - 3 } ~ = ~ 0 . 0 0 1$ and $\\log _ { 1 0 } 1 = 0$ (cid:) since $1 0 ^ { 0 } = 1$ (d) \n\nThe above results indicate that if n is an",

But mathematicians have made tables from which we can read off approximate value of the logarithm of any positive number between 1 and 10. And these are suficient for us to calculate the logarithm of any number expressed in decimal form. For this purpose, we always express the given decimal as the product of an integral power of l0 and a number between 1 and io. \n\nStandard Form of Decimal \n\nwe can express any number in decimal form, as the product of (i) an integral power of 10, and (i) a number between 1 and 10. Here are some examples: \n\n(i) 25.2 lies between 10 and 100 \n\n(ii) 1038.4 lies between 1000 and 10000. \n\n(iii) 0.005 lies between 0.001 and 0.01 ： $0 . 0 0 5 = ( 0 . 0 0 5 \\times 1 0 0 0 ) \\times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } = 5 . 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$   \n(iv) 0.00025 lies between 0.0001 and 0.001 : $\\cdot \\ 0 . 0 0 0 2 5 = ( 0 . 0 0 0 2 5 \\times 1 0 0 0 0 ) \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } = 2 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ \n\nIn each case, we divide or multiply the decimal by a power of 10, to bring one non-zero digit to the left of the decimal point, and do the reverse operation by the same power of 10, indicated separately. \n\nThus, any positive decimal can be written in the form   \n$\\mathrm { ~ n ~ } = \\mathrm { ~ m ~ } \\times \\mathrm { ~ 1 0 ~ } ^ { \\mathrm { p } }$   \nwhere $\\mathrm { p }$ is an integer (positive, zero or negative) and $1 \\leq \\mathrm { m } < 1 0$ . This is called the \"standard form of n.\" \n\nWorking Rule \n\n1. Move the decimal point to the left, or to the right, as may be necessary, to bring one non-zero digit to the left of decimal point. \n\n2. (i) If you move p places to the left, multiply by $1 0 ^ { \\mathrm { p } }$ (ii If you move p places to the right, multiply by $1 0 ^ { - \\mathrm { p } }$ (ii If you do not move the decimal point at all, multiply by $1 0 ^ { \\circ }$ (iv) Write the new decimal obtained by the power of 10 (of step 2) to obtain the standard form of the given decimal. \n\nCharacteristic and Mantissa \n\nConsider the standard form of",

When log n has been expressed as $\\mathrm { ~ p ~ + ~ l o g ~ m ~ }$ ,where $\\mathrm { p }$ is an integer and $0 \\ \\log \\mathrm { ~ m ~ } < \\ 1$ we say that $\\mathrm { p }$ is the \"characteristic\" of log n and that log m is the \"mantissa of log n. Note that characteristic is always an integer – positive, negative or zero, and mantissa is never negative and is always less than 1. If we can find the characteristics and the mantissa of log n, we have to just add them to get log n. \n\nThus to find log n, all we have to do is as follows: \n\n1. Put n in the standard form, say $\\mathrm { ~ n ~ } = \\mathrm { ~ m ~ } \\times \\ 1 0 ^ { \\mathrm { p } }$ , $1 ~ \\leq ~ \\mathrm { ~ m ~ } < 1 0$ \n\n2. Read off the characteristic $\\mathrm { p }$ of $\\log \\textbf { n }$ from this expression (exponent of 10) \n\n3. Look up log m from tables, which is being explained below. \n\n4. Write log $\\mathrm { ~ n ~ = ~ p ~ + ~ l o g ~ m ~ }$ \n\nIf the characteristic $\\mathrm { p }$ of a number n is say, 2 and the mantissa is .4133, then we have log $\\mathrm { ~ n ~ } = \\ 2$ $^ +$ .4133 which we can write as 2.4133. If, however, the characteristic p of a number m is say $- 2$ and the mantissa is .4123, then we have log $\\mathrm { ~ m ~ } { } = { } - 2 \\mathrm { ~ } { } +$ .4123. We cannot write this as -2.4123. (Why?) In order to avoid this confusion we write $\\overline { { 2 } }$ for $- 2$ and thus we write $\\log \\textrm { m } = \\textrm { \\ ' { 2 } } . 4 1 2 3$ . \n\nNow let us explain how to use the table of logarithms to find mantissas.

A table is appended at the end of this Appendix. \n\nObserve that in the table, every row starts with a two digit number, 10, 11, 12,.. 97, 98, 99. Every column is headed by a one-digit number, 0, 1, 2, …..9. On the right, we have the section called \"Mean differences\" which has 9 columns headed by 1, 2...9. \n\nNow suppose we wish to find log (6.234). Then look into the row starting with 62. In this row, look at the number in the column headed by 3. The number is 7945. This means that \n\n1 $\\mathrm { ~ \\ y ~ } ( 6 . 2 3 0 ) = 0 . 7 9 4 5 ^ { \\ast }$ \n\nBut we want log (6.234). So our answer will be a litle more than 0.7945. How much more? We look this up in the section on Mean differences. Since our fourth digit is 4, look under the column headed by 4 in the Mean difference section (in the row 62). We see the number 3 there. So add 3 to 7945. We get 7948. So we finally have \n\nlog $( 6 . 2 3 4 ) \\ : = \\ : 0 . 7 9 4 8$ . \n\nTake another example. To find log (8.127), we look in the row 81 under column 2, and we find 9096. We continue in the same row and see that the mean diference under 7 is 4. Adding this to 9096, and we get 9100. So, log $( 8 . 1 2 7 ) \\ : = \\ : 0 . 9 1 0 0$ . \n\nFinding $\\pmb { N }$ when log $\\pmb { N }$ is given \n\nWe have so far discussed the procedure for finding log n when a positive number n given. We now turn to its converse i.e., to find n when log n is given and give a method for this purpose. If log $\\mathbf { n } = \\mathbf { t }$ we sometimes say $\\mathrm { ~ n ~ } =$ antilog t. Therefore our task is given t, find its antilog. For this, we use the readymade antilog tables. \n\nSuppose log $\\mathbf { n } = 2 . 5 3 7 2$ . \n\nTo find n, first take just the mantissa of log n. In this case it is .5372. (Make sure it is positive.) Now take up antilog of this number in the antilog table which is to be used exactly like the log table. In the antilog table, the entry under column 7 in the row .53 is 3443 and the mean difference for the last digit 2 in that row is 2, so the table gives 3445. Hence, \n\nantilog $( . 5 3 7 2 ) \\ : = \\ : 3 . 4 4 5$   \nNow since log $\\mathbf { \\dot { \\tau } } _ { \\mathrm { ~ n ~ } } = \\mathbf { \\dot { \\tau } } _ { \\mathrm { ~ } } 5 3 7 2$ , the characteristic of log n is 2. So the standard form of n is given by (cid:) $\\mathrm { ~ n ~ }",

Some molar masses are given in parentheses, indicating these are values for isotopes with the largest known half-life rather than the standard atomic weight. The table includes a mix of common elements (e.g., Aluminium, Carbon, Iron) and less common or synthetic elements (e.g., Berkelium, Fermium, Meitnerium). Atomic numbers range from 1 (Hydrogen) to 109 (Meitnerium), showing a broad coverage of the periodic table. Molar masses vary widely, from 1.0079 g/mol for Hydrogen to over 258 g/mol for Mendelevium, reflecting the increasing atomic mass with higher atomic numbers. The presence of isotopic molar masses in parentheses highlights the importance of isotopic variation in atomic mass calculations. The table supports the surrounding content by providing fundamental chemical data essential for conversions and calculations involving atomic mass units, grams, and moles, which are referenced in the conversion factors and units of mass and energy discussed. It illustrates the relationship between atomic number and molar mass, foundational for understanding chemical properties and stoichiometry in chemistry. The data also complements the conversion factors by linking atomic scale measurements to macroscopic units like grams and kilograms.",

It lists various chemical elements, primarily focusing on those starting with letters from M to Z, though some entries appear combined or misaligned (e.g., 'Molybdenum Neodymium' with symbol 'Mo' and atomic number 42, and 'Neon' with symbols 'Nd Ne' and atomic numbers 60 and 10). The Atomic Number column represents the number of protons in the nucleus of each element, a fundamental identifier in the periodic table. The Molar Mass column provides the atomic mass in grams per mole, sometimes with values in parentheses indicating approximate or unstable isotopes (e.g., Neptunium (237.05), Nobelium (259)). Key data points include elements with high atomic numbers such as Rutherfordium (104) and Ununbium (112), reflecting the inclusion of transuranic and synthetic elements. Patterns show a general increase in molar mass with atomic number, consistent with periodic trends. Some entries have multiple elements or symbols combined in one row, suggesting possible formatting errors or grouping. The table supports the surrounding content by providing specific atomic and molar mass data that complement the conversion factors and unit definitions given earlier, enabling precise calculations in chemical and physical contexts. It illustrates the relationship between atomic number and molar mass, essential for understanding atomic structure and stoichiometry in chemistry. The presence of both stable and radioactive elements aligns with the comprehensive nature of the chemical data presented in the surrounding text.",

The first and third columns list the chemical reduction half-reactions, while the second and fourth columns provide their standard reduction potentials (E°/V). The potentials range from highly positive values (up to +3.0 V) to negative values (down to approximately -0.76 V), indicating the relative oxidizing or reducing strength of the species involved. Key data points include the highest potential reaction, H4XeO6 + 2H+ + 2e− → XeO3 + 3H2O at +3.0 V, and the lowest potential Zn2+ + 2e− → Zn at -0.76 V. The table reveals a clear trend where species with higher positive E° values are stronger oxidizing agents, while those with negative values are stronger reducing agents. The presence of common ions such as Cu, Ag, Fe, Mn, and Cl in various oxidation states illustrates the electrochemical series and standard potentials at 298 K, supporting the surrounding content's focus on fundamental chemical conversions and units. This table complements the context by providing essential electrochemical data that underpin redox reactions, which are critical in chemical thermodynamics and kinetics. The data also illustrate the relationship between chemical species and their electron transfer tendencies, reinforcing concepts of oxidation-reduction potential and standard electrode potentials discussed in the surrounding material.",

Each row pairs two different half-reactions with their E° values, facilitating comparison. The reduction half-reactions involve various metal ions and their reduction to elemental metals or metal hydroxides to metals, reflecting their tendency to gain electrons. The E° values range from -0.81 V to -3.05 V, indicating the relative ease or difficulty of reduction under standard conditions at 298 K. Notably, half-reactions involving alkali metals such as Li+, K+, and Rb+ have the most negative potentials (around -2.9 to -3.05 V), signifying their strong reducing nature and low tendency to be reduced. Conversely, reactions like Cd(OH)2 + 2e- → Cd + 2OH- have less negative potentials (-0.81 V), indicating a higher reduction potential. The table supports the surrounding content on standard potentials by providing concrete numerical values that rank elements electrochemically, which is essential for understanding redox reactions and electrochemical series. This data underpins the theoretical discussion on logarithms and electrochemical calculations by supplying the fundamental potentials needed for Nernst equation applications and related logarithmic computations in electrochemistry. The relationship between the half-reactions and their potentials illustrates the concept of electron transfer and energy changes, which are critical in chemical kinetics and thermodynamics as introduced in the surrounding text.",

Each equation expresses the logarithm of a number with respect to a given base, showing that the logarithm log_a(b) equals the exponent m such that a^m = b. Specifically, log_2(8) = 3 because 2^3 = 8; log_3(9) = 2 because 3^2 = 9; log_5(125) = 3 because 5^3 = 125; and log_7(1) = 0 because 7^0 = 1.

The equation uses the logarithm product rule: log(n) = log(m × 10^p) = log(m) + log(10^p). Applying the power rule of logarithms, log(10^p) = p × log(10). Since the base is 10, log(10) = 1, simplifying the expression to log(n) = p + log(m). Here, p is the characteristic (an integer) representing the order of magnitude of n, and log(m) is the mantissa (a fractional part between 0 and 1). This decomposition is fundamental in logarithmic computations, enabling the separation of scale (characteristic) from precision (mantissa). It facilitates the use of logarithm tables for m, simplifying the calculation of log(n) for arbitrary positive decimals. The equation is central to numerical methods, scientific notation, and computational efficiency in logarithmic operations, linking the concept of standard form representation with logarithmic properties and their practical application in calculations and data analysis.",

The columns are headed by digits 0 through 9, repeated twice, indicating the decimal places for the mantissa values. The rows are indexed by integers such as 61, 62, 63, representing the first two digits of the number whose logarithm mantissa is being looked up. Each cell contains a four-digit number representing the mantissa of the logarithm for a number formed by combining the row index and the column header digits. For example, the cell at row 61 and column 0 contains 7853, which corresponds to the mantissa of log(6.10) or log(6.1). The table includes some missing or unclear entries, but the general pattern shows increasing mantissa values as the numbers increase, consistent with the logarithmic function's monotonicity. The last columns in each row appear to contain single-digit numbers, possibly indicating the characteristic or an auxiliary index, but their exact role is ambiguous without further context. This table supports the explanation in the surrounding text about how to find the mantissa of a logarithm for numbers between 1 and 10, which is essential for calculating logarithms of any decimal number by expressing it in standard form (m × 10^p). The table thus illustrates the practical application of the logarithm laws and the decomposition of logarithms into characteristic and mantissa, facilitating easier computation as described in the text.",

This equation relates directly to the broader discussion on converting numbers to standard form to find logarithms and antilogarithms efficiently, and it exemplifies the practical use of scientific notation in logarithmic tables and calculations.

Its presence suggests a transition point in the document, potentially leading to extended data or explanatory notes that support the main instructional content on page 7. Although minimal, this discarded heading is significant for knowledge retrieval as it marks a structural division and indicates where further detailed resources might be found, thus aiding navigation and comprehension of the broader mathematical discussion.",

There are no key informational elements, relationships, or components within this snippet itself. Contextually, it appears after detailed mathematical explanations and examples related to logarithms and antilogarithms on page 7, serving as a publication or versioning note rather than contributing to the mathematical discourse.

rows labeled by the integer 'N' values ranging from 10 to 46 and beyond, and columns labeled from 0 to 9, with additional grouped columns labeled as '1 2 3', '4 5 6', and '7 8 9'. Each cell contains numerical values representing logarithmic values or related indices used for logarithmic calculations. The table is organized to facilitate quick lookup of logarithm values for numbers, supporting the manual calculation of logarithms and antilogarithms as demonstrated in the surrounding content. The column headers represent digits or digit groups, indicating the decimal places or significant figures for which logarithms are tabulated. Key data points include the logarithm values for numbers such as 10, 11, 12, etc., with values like 0000id for 10, 04140453 for 11, and 07920828 for 12, showing the logarithmic progression. Patterns show increasing logarithm values with increasing numbers, consistent with logarithmic function properties. Statistical insights reveal a smooth incremental increase in logarithm values, supporting interpolation for intermediate values. The relationships between data elements are hierarchical, with the row number 'N' representing the integer part and the columns representing decimal expansions or significant digits, enabling precise logarithm determination. The significance of this data lies in its role as a reference for logarithmic calculations, crucial for solving problems involving powers, roots, and divisions as illustrated in the surrounding examples. The table supports the concepts of logarithmic manipulation, such as converting multiplication and division into addition and subtraction of logarithms, and finding powers and roots by multiplying logarithms by fractional exponents. This table is essential for manual logarithmic computations before the advent of calculators, illustrating the practical application of logarithms in mathematical problem-solving.",

None\n\nAnalysis: The table is a continuation of logarithmic values, specifically from a section titled 'LOGARITHMS' on page 9, and precedes a section on 'ANTILOGARITHMS' on page 11, indicating its role in providing logarithmic data for mathematical or scientific calculations. The table is organized with the first column labeled 'N' representing the base number for which logarithms are tabulated, ranging from 51 to 97 and beyond, including some multi-row entries for larger numbers. Subsequent columns contain numerical values that represent logarithmic values or related data points, arranged in groups and subgroups, often with multiple digits per cell, suggesting detailed logarithmic values to several decimal places or parts of logarithmic tables. The column headers include digits and grouped numbers such as '6', '8', '9', and grouped sequences like '1 2 3', '4 5 6', '7 8 9', which likely correspond to decimal places or logarithmic increments. The data shows a pattern of increasing logarithmic values as N increases, consistent with the mathematical property that logarithms increase with their argument. Some cells contain multiple numbers or grouped digits, indicating detailed subdivisions or interpolations within the logarithmic values. The table supports the surrounding content by providing the necessary logarithmic values for calculations, illustrating the concept of logarithms and their tabulated use before the introduction of antilogarithms. It serves as a practical reference for users to find logarithmic values for numbers between 51 and 97 (and beyond), facilitating computations in scientific and engineering contexts. The relationships between the data elements show a systematic progression of logarithmic values, with the first column as the input number and the subsequent columns providing the corresponding logarithmic outputs or related increments. This detailed tabulation exemplifies the historical and practical approach to logarithmic calculations before digital computation, emphasizing accuracy and granularity in the values presented.",

Structurally, it appears as a footer or header element, likely denoting a page number and a section title. This fragment is isolated and lacks substantive content, suggesting it was excluded from the main body of the document. The surrounding context includes logarithm tables on page 9 and antilogarithm tables on page 11, indicating that page 10 serves as a transitional or supplementary page. The presence of 'Appendix' implies additional reference material or supplementary data related to the logarithm tables.

6</td></tr></table>\nFootnotes: None\n\nAnalysis: The table is a continuation of logarithm and antilogarithm tables, specifically labeled as TABLE II under the topic of ANTILOGARITHMS. It is organized with multiple rows and columns, where the first two columns represent the variable 'N' with decimal increments from 0.01 to 0.47 and beyond, indicating the input values for which antilogarithms are calculated. The subsequent columns contain numerical values representing the antilogarithm results corresponding to these 'N' values. The column headers include digits such as 0, 4, 6, 8, 9, and grouped digits like 3, 4 5 6, 7 8 9, which likely denote the decimal places or specific segments of the antilogarithm values. The data shows a progressive increase in the antilogarithm values as 'N' increases, consistent with the mathematical property that antilogarithms grow exponentially with the logarithm input. The table also includes grouped values in some cells, possibly indicating ranges or multiple related values for certain 'N' increments. The presence of repeated patterns in the last columns with small integers (0,1,2,3,4,5,6) suggests these might be indices, error margins, or additional parameters related to the antilogarithm calculations. This table supports the surrounding content by providing detailed numerical data essential for converting logarithmic values back to their original numbers, a fundamental operation in logarithmic calculations. It illustrates the practical application of antilogarithms, enabling users to find the original number from its logarithm, which is critical in scientific computations and engineering contexts.",

The content is minimal and lacks structural elements such as headings or data tables, indicating it may be a header, footer, or marginal note unrelated to the main mathematical tables. Its presence suggests a possible course or subject reference, potentially marking a section or page related to a Chemistry course, but it does not contribute directly to the logarithmic content. The relationship to surrounding content is tenuous, serving more as a contextual or metadata artifact rather than substantive content. This discarded snippet is relevant for knowledge retrieval as a metadata tag or identifier that could assist in cataloging or cross-referencing the document's sections, but it does not support the mathematical discussion on logarithms and antilogarithms.",

titled 'ANTILOGARITHMS' on page 11, indicating it is part of a mathematical or logarithmic reference resource. The table is organized with a primary column labeled 'N' representing a base value or index, followed by columns labeled 0 through 9, and additional grouped columns labeled '1 2 3', '4 5 6', and '7 8 9'. These columns likely represent decimal or digit increments used to find antilogarithm values. The data entries are numerical values, mostly in the 3000 to 9000 range, which correspond to antilogarithm values for the given 'N' and digit increments. The table shows a structured progression of values increasing as 'N' and the digit columns increase, reflecting the mathematical property of antilogarithms where values grow exponentially with the input. The presence of grouped columns with multiple digits (e.g., '1 2 3') suggests a compact representation of related antilogarithm values for combined digit inputs. The table supports the surrounding content by providing detailed numerical data necessary for calculating antilogarithms, which are essential in various scientific and engineering calculations. The relationships between the 'N' values and the digit columns illustrate how antilogarithm values change with small increments, facilitating interpolation or lookup in logarithmic computations. The table's detailed numeric progression and grouping align with the concept of logarithmic tables used historically before digital calculators, emphasizing its role as a reference tool for precise mathematical operations.",

This fragment lacks substantive informational content but serves as a navigational or organizational marker. Its presence immediately following the continuation of 'TABLE II' on page 11 indicates a shift from tabular data on antilogarithms to supplementary material or additional sections.

The key element is the phrase indicating a reprint date or edition year, which suggests a publication or versioning detail. This component relates to the broader document as a bibliographic or publication metadata marker, likely intended to inform readers about the edition or reprint timeline.

The key element is the phrase itself, which implies the content was meant to provide solutions or responses to exercise questions, likely corresponding to the numerical data and chemical/physical values listed in the surrounding units. The relationship between this discarded heading and the surrounding content is that it serves as a thematic marker or organizational label, connecting the numerical and formulaic data to their explanatory answers. Contextually, it supports the broader discussion by indicating the presence of an answer section, which is critical for knowledge retrieval as it guides users to solution content related to the exercises in the units.

This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). \n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.

We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). \n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. \n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calender so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children's life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. \n\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor B. L. Khandelwal for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which wil enable us to undertake further revision and refinement. \n\nNew Delhi 20 November 2006 \n\nDirector National Council of Educational Research and Training \n\nIn view of the COviD-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise. - \n\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following: \n\nOverlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class   \n● Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject   \n• Difficulty level Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning   \n● Content, which is irrelevant in the present context \n\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above. \n\nChemistry has made a profound impact on the society. It is intimately linked to the well-being of human kind. The rate of advancements in chemistry is so high that curriculum developers continuously look for strategies to cope with these advancements. Also, the students have to be inspired to be the future leaders who would make fundamental contributions. The present textbook is a sincere effort in this direction. \n\nThe structure of the textbook, presented in two parts, comprises of sixteen Units. Although the titles of various Units indicate a sort of compartmentalisation into physical, inorganic and organic chemistry, readers will",

Also, the students have to be inspired to be the future leaders who would make fundamental contributions. The present textbook is a sincere effort in this direction. \n\nThe structure of the textbook, presented in two parts, comprises of sixteen Units. Although the titles of various Units indicate a sort of compartmentalisation into physical, inorganic and organic chemistry, readers will find that these sub-disciplines have been intermingled, at least to a certain extent, to have a unified approach to the subject. The approach of presentation of the subject matter discourages students from rote memorisation. The subject has in fact, been organised around the laws and principles of chemistry. As students master these laws and principles, they will soon get to the point where they can predict much of what will come. \n\nEfforts have been directed towards making the subject stimulating and exciting by references to the historical developments and its usefulness to our lives, wherever appropriate. The text is well illustrated with examples from surrounding environment to facilitate grasping of the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the concept easily. Physical data are given in SI units throughout the book to make comparison of various properties easier. IUPAC system of nomenclature has been followed along with the common system. Structural formulae of chemical compounds showing functional/coordinating groups in different colours are drawn using electronic system. Each Unit has a good number of examples, as illustrations, with their solutions and some intext questions, the answers of some of which are given at the end of the Unit. The end of Unit exercises are designed to apply important principles and provoke thinking process to solve them. Answers of some of these exercises are given at the end of the book. \n\nA variety of materials, e.g., biographical sketches of some scientists, additional information related to a particular topic, etc., is given in boxes with a deep yellow coloured bar. This boxed material with a 'deep yellow bar' is to bring additional life to the topic. However, it is non-evaluative. The structures of some of the more complex compounds incorporated in the book are for understanding their chemistry. As their reproduction would lead to memorisation, it is also a non-evaluative portion of the text. \n\nThe information part has been significantly reduced and, wherever possible, it has been substantiated with facts. However, it is necessary for students to be aware of commercially important chemicals, their process of manufacture and sources of raw materials. This leads to descriptive material in the book. Attempts have been made to make descriptions of such compounds interesting by considering their structures and reactivity. Thermodynamics, kinetics and electrochemical aspects have been applied to chemical reactions which should be beneficial to students for understanding why a particular reaction happened and why a particular property is exhibited by the product. There is currently great awareness of environmental and energy issues which are directly related to chemistry. Such issues have been highlighted and dealt with at appropriate places in the book. \n\nA team of experts constituted by the NCERT has developed the manuscript of the book. It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the valuable contribution of all the members of this team. I also acknowledge the valuable and relentless contribution of the editors in bringing the book to the present shape. I also acknowledge with thanks the dedicated efforts and valuable contribution of Professor Brahm Parkash, who not only coordinated the entire programme but also actively involved in writing and editing of this book. Thanks are also due to the participating teachers and subject experts of the review workshop for their contribution, which has helped us to make the book learner friendly. Also, I thank the technical and administrative staff of the NCERT for their support in the entire process. \n\nThe team of this textbook development programme hopes that the book stimulates its readers and makes them feel the excitement and fascination for this subject.

The composition centers on a teacher, a middle-aged man wearing a light blue shirt and dark trousers, standing beside a large blackboard filled with chemical equations and diagrams written in white chalk. The blackboard spans the width of the image and contains detailed chemical notations, including molecular structures and reaction mechanisms, indicative of an advanced chemistry topic. In front of the blackboard, several students, both boys and girls aged approximately 16-18 years, are seated at wooden desks arranged in rows facing the teacher. The students are attentively looking at the teacher and the blackboard, some taking notes in notebooks. The classroom walls are painted a pale cream color, and there are educational posters related to chemistry pinned on the side walls, adding to the academic atmosphere. Natural light streams in from windows on the left side, casting soft shadows and illuminating the room evenly. The overall visual style is realistic and documentary, capturing a typical Indian senior secondary school chemistry class environment. The image relates to the surrounding context as it visually represents the practical teaching and learning environment for Class XII Chemistry, complementing the textbook's emphasis on interactive and student-centered education as outlined in the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005. The presence of detailed chemical content on the blackboard aligns with the textbook's focus on rigorous subject knowledge and hands-on learning experiences. The photograph underscores the role of the teacher in facilitating understanding and the engagement of students in scientific inquiry, reflecting the educational principles discussed in the adjacent text.",
