Most of these are mixtures containing two or more pure substances. Their utility or importance in life depends on their composition. For example, the properties of brass (mixture of copper and zinc) are quite different from those of German silver (mixture of copper, zinc and nickel) or bronze (mixture of copper and tin); 1 part per million (ppm) of fluoride ions in water prevents tooth decay, while $1 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { p p m }$ causes the tooth to become mottled and high concentrations of fluoride ions can be poisonous (for example, sodium fluoride is used in rat poison); intravenous injections are always dissolved in water containing salts at particular ionic concentrations that match with blood plasma concentrations and so on. \n\nIn this Unit, we will consider mostly liquid solutions and their formation. This wil be followed by studying the properties of the solutions, like vapour pressure and colligative properties. We will begin with types of solutions and then various alternatives in which concentrations of a solute can be expressed in liquid solution. \n\nSolutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more than two components. By homogenous mixture we mean that its composition and properties are uniform throughout the mixture. Generally, the component that is present in the largest quantity is known as solvent. Solvent determines the physical state in which solution exists. One or more components present in the solution other than solvent are called solutes. In this Unit we shall consider only binary solutions (i.e., consisting of two components). Here each component may be solid, liquid or in gaseous state and are summarised in Table 1.1. \n\nComposition of a solution can be described by expressing its concentration. The latter can be expressed either qualitatively or quantitatively. For example, qualitatively we can say that the solution is dilute (i.e., relatively very small quantity of solute) or it is concentrated (i.e., relatively very large quantity of solute). But in real life these kinds of description can add to lot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description of the solution. \n\nThere are several ways by which we can describe the concentration of the solution quantitatively. \n\n(i) Mass percentage (w/w): The mass percentage of a component of a solution is defined as: Mass $\\%$ of a component \n\nFor example, if a solution is described by $1 0 \\%$ glucose in water by mass, it means that $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of glucose is dissolved in $9 0 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ of water resulting in a $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ solution. Concentration described by mass percentage is commonly used in industrial chemical applications. For example, commercial bleaching solution contains 3.62 mass percentage of sodium hypochlorite in water. \n\n(ii) Volume percentage $( V / V )$ : The volume percentage is defined as: Volume $\\%$ of a component $=$ Volume of the component ×100 Total volume of solution \n\nFor example, $1 0 \\%$ ethanol solution in water means that $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { \\ m L }$ of ethanol is dissolved in water such that the total volume of the solution is $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m L } }$ .

Solutions containing liquids are commonly expressed in this unit. For example, a $3 5 \\% ~ ( v / v )$ solution of ethylene glycol, an antifreeze, is used in cars for cooling the engine. At this concentration the antifreeze lowers the freezing point of water to 255.4K $\\left( - 1 7 . 6 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } \\right)$ . \n\n(ii) Mass by volume percentage $( \\mathbf { w } / V )$ : Another unit which is commonly used in medicine and pharmacy is mass by volume percentage. It is the mass of solute dissolved in $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m L }$ of the solution. \n\n(iv) Parts per million: When a solute is present in trace quantities, it is convenient to express concentration in parts per million (ppm) and is defined as: \n\nParts per million $=$ \n\nAs in the case of percentage, concentration in parts per million can also be expressed as mass to mass, volume to volume and mass to volume.

Such a small concentration is also expressed as $5 . 8 \\textrm { g }$ per $1 0 ^ { 6 } \\ \\mathrm { \\ g }$ (cid:) $( 5 . 8 \\mathrm { \\ p p m } )$ of sea water. The concentration of pollutants in water or atmosphere is often expressed in terms of $\\mu \\mathrm { g } \\ \\bar { \\mathrm { m L } } ^ { - 1 }$ or ppm. \n\n(v) Mole fraction: Commonly used symbol for mole fraction is $x$ and subscript used on the right hand side of $x$ denotes the component.

It depends upon the nature of solute and solvent as well as temperature and pressure. Let us consider the effect of these factors in solution of a solid or a gas in a liquid. \n\n1.3.1 Solubility of a Solid in a Liquid \n\nEvery solid does not dissolve in a given liquid. while sodium chloride and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do not. On the other hand, naphthalene and anthracene dissolve readily in benzene but sodium chloride and sugar do not. It is observed that polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents and non polar solutes in nonpolar solvents. In general, a solute dissolves in a solvent if the intermolecular interactions are similar in the two or we may say like dissolves like. \n\nwhen a solid solute is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves and its concentration increases in solution. This process is known as dissolution. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute particles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as crystallisation. A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the same rate. Under such conditions, number of 'solute particles going into solution will be equal to the solute particles separating out and a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached. \n\nSolute $^ +$ Solvent Solution \n\nAt this stage the concentration of solute in solution will remain constant under the given conditions, i.e., temperature and pressure. Similar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents. Such a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature and pressure is called a saturated solution. An unsaturated solution is one in which more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium with undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the maximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent. Thus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility. \n\nEarlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into another depends on the nature of the substances.

In addition to these variables, two other parameters, i.e., temperature and pressure also control this phenomenon. \n\nEffect of temperature \n\nThe solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature changes. Consider the equilibrium represented by equation 1.10. This, being dynamic equilibrium, must follow Le Chateliers Principle. In general, if in a nearly saturated solution, the dissolution process is endothermic $( \\Delta _ { \\mathrm { s o l } } \\ \\mathrm { ~ H ~ } > \\ 0 )$ , the solubility should increase with rise in temperature and if it is exothermic $( \\Delta _ { \\mathrm { s o l } } \\ \\mathrm { H } < 0 )$ the solubility should decrease. These trends are also observed experimentally. \n\nEffect of pressure \n\nPressure does not have any significant effect on solubility of solids in liquids. It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible and practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure. \n\n1.3.2 Solubility of a Gas in a Liquid \n\nMany gases dissolve in water. Oxygen dissolves only to a small extent in water. It is this dissolved oxygen which sustains all aquatic life. On the other hand, hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) is highly soluble in water. Solubility of gases in liquids is greatly affected by pressure and temperature. The solubility of gases increase with increase of pressure. For solution of gases in a solvent, consider a system as shown in Fig. 1.1 (a). The lower part is solution and the upper part is gaseous system at pressure $p$ and temperature $T .$ Assume this system to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of gaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same. Now increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the gas to a smaller volume [Fig. 1.1 (b)]. This will increase the number of gaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate at which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to enter it. The solubility of the gas will increase until a new equilibrium is reached resulting in an increase in the pressure of a gas above the solution and thus its solubility increases. \n\nHenry was the first to give a quantitative relation between pressure and solubility of a gas in a solvent which is known as Henry's law. The law states that at a constant temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas present above the surface of liquid or solution. Dalton, a contemporary of Henry, also concluded independently that the solubility of a gas in a liquid solution is a function of partial pressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in the solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be said that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over the solution. The most commonly used form of Henry's law states that \"the partial pressure of the gas in vapour phase $\\pmb { \\left[ p \\right] }$ is proportional to the mole fraction of the gas $\\pmb { \\left\\{ x \\right\\} }$ in the solution\" and is expressed as: \n\nHere $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ is the Henry's law constant.

If we draw a graph between partial pressure of the gas versus mole fraction of the gas in solution, then we should get a plot of the type as shown in Fig. 1.2. \n\nDifferent gases have different $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ values at the same temperature (Table 1.2). This suggests that $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ is a function of the nature of the gas. \n\nIt is obvious from equation (1.11) that higher the value of $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ at a given pressure, the lower is the solubility of the gas in the liquid. It can be seen from Table 1.2 that $\\mathrm { K } _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ values for both $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { { O } } _ { 2 }$ increase with increase of temperature indicating that the solubility of gases increases with decrease of temperature. It is due to this reason that aquatic species are more comfortable in cold waters rather than in warm waters. - \n\nExample 1.4 $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ gas is bubbled through water at $2 9 3 \\ \\mathrm { K }$ , how many millimoles of $\\mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ gas would dissolve in 1 litre of water? Assume that $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ exerts a partial pressure of O.987 bar. Given that Henry's law constant for $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ at 293 K is 76.48 kbar. - \n\nSolution The solubility of gas is related to the mole fraction in aqueous solution. The mole fraction of the gas in the solution is calculated by applying Henry's law. Thus: \n\nAs 1 litre of water contains $5 5 . 5 \\mathrm { m o l }$ of it, therefore if $n$ represents number of moles of $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ in solution, \n\n$x \\left( { \\mathrm { N i t r o g e n } } \\right) = { \\frac { n { \\mathrm { ~ m o l ~ } } } { n { \\mathrm { ~ m o l } } + 5 5 . 5 { \\mathrm { ~ m o l } } } } = { \\frac { n } { 5 5 . 5 } } = 1 . 2 9 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ (cd $n$ in denominator is neglected as it is $< < 5 5 . 5 ]$ (id:) Thus $n = 1 . 2 9 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \\times 5 5 . 5 \\mathrm { m o l } = 7 . 1 6 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \\mathrm { m o l }$ $= { \\frac { 7 . 1 6 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { - 4 } { \\mathrm { ~ m o l } } \\times 1 0 0 0 { \\mathrm { ~ m m o l } } } { \\mathrm { 1 ~ m o l } } } = 0 . 7 1 6 { \\mathrm { ~ m m o l } }$ \n\nHenry's law finds several applications in industry and explains some biological phenomena.

Notable among these are: \n\n• To increase the solubility of $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in soft drinks and soda water, the bottle is sealed under high pressure. • Scuba divers must cope with high concentrations of dissolved gases while breathing air at high pressure underwater. Increased pressure increases the solubility of atmospheric gases in blood. when the divers come towards surface, the pressure gradually decreases. This releases the dissolved gases and leads to the formation of bubbles of nitrogen in the blood. This blocks capillaries and creates a medical condition known as bends, which are painful and dangerous to life. \n\nTo avoid bends, as well as, the toxic effects of high concentrations of nitrogen in the blood, the tanks used by scuba divers are filled with air diluted with helium $. 1 1 . 7 \\%$ helium, $5 6 . 2 \\%$ nitrogen and $3 2 . 1 \\%$ oxygen). \n\n• At high altitudes the partial pressure of oxygen is less than that at the ground level. This leads to low concentrations of oxygen in the blood and tissues of people living at high altitudes or climbers. Low blood oxygen causes climbers to become weak and unable to think clearly, symptoms of a condition known as anoxia. \n\nEffect of Temperature \n\nSolubility of gases in liquids decreases with rise in temperature. when dissolved, the gas molecules are present in liquid phase and the process of dissolution can be considered similar to condensation and heat is evolved in this process. We have learnt in the last Section that dissolution process involves dynamic equilibrium and thus must follow Le Chatelier's Principle.

The solute may or may not be volatile. We shall discuss the properties of only binary solutions, that is, the solutions containing two components, namely, the solutions of (i) liquids in liquids and (i) solids in liquids. \n\n1.4.1 Vapour Pressure of LiquidLiquid Solutions \n\nLet us consider a binary solution of two volatile liquids and denote the two components as 1 and 2. when taken in a closed vessel, both the components would evaporate and eventually an equilibrium would be established between vapour phase and the liquid phase. Let the total vapour pressure at this stage be $p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } }$ and $p _ { 1 }$ and $p _ { 2 }$ be the partial vapour pressures of the two components 1 and 2 respectively. These partial pressures are related to the mole fractions $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ of the two components 1 and 2 respectively. \n\nThe French chemist, Francois Marte Raoult (1886) gave the quantitative relationship between them. The relationship is known as the Raoult's law which states that for a solution of volatile liquids, the partial vapour pressure of each component of the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction present in solution. \n\nThus, for component 1 an $\\begin{array} { r l } & { p _ { 1 } \\propto x _ { 1 } } \\\\ { \\textrm { d } } & { p _ { 1 } = \\ p _ { 1 } ^ { 0 } \\ x _ { 1 } } \\end{array}$ \n\nwhere $p _ { 1 } ^ { 0 }$ is the vapour pressure of pure component 1 at the same temperature. \n\nSimilarly, for component 2 \n\nwhere ${ p _ { 2 } } ^ { 0 }$ represents the vapour pressure of the pure component 2. \n\nAccording to Dalton's law of partial pressures, the total pressure $( p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } } )$ over the solution phase in the container will be the sum of the partial pressures of the components of the solution and is given as: \n\nSubstituting the values of $p _ { 1 }$ and $p _ { 2 }$ , we get \n\nFollowing conclusions can be drawn from equation (1.16). \n\n(i) Total vapour pressure over the solution can be related to the mole fraction of any one component. \n\n(ii) Total vapour pressure over the solution varies linearly with the mole fraction of component 2. \n\n(ii) Depending on the vapour pressures of the pure components 1 and 2, total vapour pressure over the solution decreases or increases with the increase of the mole fraction of component 1. \n\nA plot of $p _ { 1 }$ or $p _ { 2 }$ versus the mole fractions $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ for a solution gives a linear plot as shown in Fig. 1.3. These lines (I and I) pass through the points for which $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ are equal to unity. Similarly the plot (line II) of $p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } }$ versus $x _ { 2 }$ is also linear (Fig. 1.3).

Only the proportionality constant $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ diff ers from ${ p _ { 1 } } ^ { 0 }$ . Thus, Raoult's law becomes a special case of Henry's law in which $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ becomes equal to ${ p _ { 1 } } ^ { 0 }$ . \n\n1.4.3 Vapour Pressure of Solutions of Solids in Liquids \n\nAnother important class of solutions consists of solids dissolved in liquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and cane sugar in water and iodine", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-bf16f4e74898957bb4b565cf021ac493", "__created_at__": 1762850509, "content": "^ { 0 }$ . Thus, Raoult's law becomes a special case of Henry's law in which $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ becomes equal to ${ p _ { 1 } } ^ { 0 }$ . \n\n1.4.3 Vapour Pressure of Solutions of Solids in Liquids \n\nAnother important class of solutions consists of solids dissolved in liquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and cane sugar in water and iodine and sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide. Some physical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of pure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. Liquids at a given temperature vapourise and under equilibrium conditions the pressure exerted by the vapours of the liquid over the liquid phase is called vapour pressure [Fig. 1.4 (a)]. In 1a pure liquid the entire surface is occupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a non-volatile solute is added to a solvent to give a solution [Fig. 1.4.(b)], the vapour pressure of the solution is solely from the solvent alone. This vapour pressure of the solution at a given temperature is found to be lower than the vapour pressure of the pure solvent at the same temperature. In the solution, the surface has both solute and solvent molecules; thereby the fraction of the surface covered by the solvent molecules gets reduced. Consequently, the number of solvent molecules escaping from the surface is correspondingly reduced, thus, the vapour pressure is also reduced. \n\nThe decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the quantity of non-volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of its nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by adding $1 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }$ of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that produced by adding $1 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }$ of urea to the same quantity of water at the same temperature. \n\nRaoult's law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction. \n\nIn a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by 2. When the solute is non-volatile, only the solvent molecules are present in vapour phase and contribute to vapour pressure. Let $p _ { 1 }$ be the vapour pressure of the solvent, $x _ { 1 }$ be its mole fraction, ${ p } _ { \\mathrm { i } } ^ { 0 }$ be its vapour pressure in the pure state. Then according to Raoult's law \n\nThe proportionality constant is equal to the vapour pressure of pure solvent, $p _ { 1 } ^ { 0 }$ ; A plot between the vapour pressure and the mole fraction of the solvent is linear (Fig. 1.5). \n\n1.5 Ideal and Nonideal Solutions \n\n1.5.1 Ideal Solutions \n\nLiquid-liquid solutions can be classified into ideal and non-ideal solutions on the basis of Raoult's law. - \n\nThe solutions which obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration are known as ideal solutions. The ideal solutions have two other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the pure components to form the solution is zero and the volume of mixing is also zero, i.e., \n\nIt means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components are mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of volumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of the solutions can be explained by considering two components A and B. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will be of types A-A and B-B, whereas", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-4e278f6362ce974eb772aa7b3e944d94", "__created_at__": 1762850509, "content": "py of mixing of the pure components to form the solution is zero and the volume of mixing is also zero, i.e., \n\nIt means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components are mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of volumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of the solutions can be explained by considering two components A and B. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will be of types A-A and B-B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition to these two interactions, A-B type of interactions will also be present. If the intermolecular attractive forces between the A-A and B-B are nearly equal to those between A-B, this leads to the formation of ideal solution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly ideal in behaviour. Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane, bromoethane and chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. fall into this category. \n\n1.5.2 Non-ideal Solutions \n\nWhen a solution does not obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration, then it is called non-ideal solution. The vapour pressure of such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by Raoult's law (equation 1.16). If it is higher, the solution exhibits positive deviation and if it is lower, it exhibits negative deviation from Raoult's law. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions for such solutions are shown in Fig. 1.6. \n\nThe cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the molecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult's law, A-B interactions are weaker than those between A-A or B-B, i.e., in this case the intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules are weaker than those between the solute-solute and solvent-solvent molecules. This means that in such solutions, molecules of A (or B) will find it easier to escape than in pure state. This will increase the vapour pressure and result in positive deviation. Mixtures of ethanol and acetone behave in this manner. In pure ethanol, molecules are hydrogen bonded. On adding acetone, its molecules get in between the host molecules and break some of the hydrogen bonds between them. Due to weakening of interactions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult's law [Fig. 1.6 (a)]. In a solution formed by adding carbon disulphide to acetone, the dipolar interactions between solute-solvent molecules are weaker than the respective interactions among the solute-solute and solvent-solvent molecules. This solution also shows positive deviation. \n\nIn case of negative deviations from Raoult's law, the intermolecular attractive forces between A-A and B-B are weaker than those between A-B and leads to decrease in vapour pressure resulting in negative deviations. An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline. In this case the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic proton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the respective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar molecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone forms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult's law. This is because chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen bond with acetone molecule as shown. \n\nThis decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each component and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting in negative deviation from Raoult's law [Fig. 1.6. (b)]. \n\nSome liquids on mixing, form azeotropes which are binary mixtures having the same composition in liquid and vapour phase and boil at a constant temperature. In such cases, it is not possible to separate the components by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes called minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-c99e9f9a17b49c995083dfd9e169808b", "__created_at__": 1762850509, "content": "escaping tendency of molecules for each component and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting in negative deviation from Raoult's law [Fig. 1.6.

In such cases, it is not possible to separate the components by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes called minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling azeotrope. The solutions which show a large positive deviation from Raoult's law form minimum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. \n\nFor example, ethanol-water mixture (obtained by fermentation of sugars) on fractional distillation gives a solution containing approximately $9 5 \\%$ by volume of ethanol. Once this composition, known as azeotrope composition, has been achieved, the liquid and vapour have the same composition, and no further separation occurs. \n\nThe solutions that show large negative deviation from Raoult's law form maximum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. Nitric acid and water is an example of this class of azeotrope. This azeotrope has the approximate composition, $6 8 \\%$ nitric acid and $3 2 \\%$ water by mass, with a boiling point of 393.5 K. \n\nIntext Question \n\n1.8 The vapour pressure of pure liquids A and B are 450 and $7 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m \\ H g }$ respectively, at 350 K .

There are many properties of solutions which are connected with this decrease of vapour pressure. These are: (1) relative lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent (2) depression of freezing point of the solvent (3) elevation of boiling point of the solvent and (4) osmotic pressure of the solution. All these properties depend on the number of solute particles irrespective of their nature relative to the total number of particles present in the solution. Such properties are called colligative properties (colligative: from Latin: co means together, ligare means to bind). In the following Sections we will discuss these properties one by one. \n\n1.6.1 Relative Lowering of Vapour Pressure \n\nWe have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of a solvent in solution is less than that of the pure solvent. Raoult established that the lowering of vapour pressure depends only on the concentration of the solute particles and it is independent of their identity. The equation (1.20) given in Section 1.4.3 establishes a relation between vapour pressure of the solution, mole fraction and vapour pressure of the solvent, i.e., \n\nThe reduction in the vapour pressure of solvent $( \\Delta p _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } )$ is given as: \n\nKnowing that $x _ { 2 } = 1 - x _ { 1 }$ , equation (1.23) reduces to \n\nIn a solution containing several non-volatile solutes, the lowering of the vapour pressure depends on the sum of the mole fraction of different solutes. \n\nEquation (1.24) can be written as \n\nThe expression on the left hand side of the equation as mentioned earlier is called relative lowering of vapour pressure and is equal to the mole fraction of the solute.

It boils at the temperature at which its vapour pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at 373.15 K $\\mathrm { ( 1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } C ) }$ because at this temperature the vapour pressure of water is 1.013 bar (1 atmosphere). We have also learnt in the last section that vapour pressure of the solvent decreases in the presence of non-volatile solute. Fig. 1.7 depicts the variation of vapour pressure of the pure solvent and solution as a function of temperature. For example, the vapour pressure of an aqueous solution of sucrose is less than 1.013 bar at 373.15 K. In order to make this solution boil, its vapour pressure must be increased to 1.013 bar by raising the temperature above the boiling temperature of the pure solvent (water).

Fig. 1.7 depicts the variation of vapour pressure of the pure solvent and solution as a function of temperature. For example, the vapour pressure of an aqueous solution of sucrose is less than 1.013 bar at 373.15 K. In order to make this solution boil, its vapour pressure must be increased to 1.013 bar by raising the temperature above the boiling temperature of the pure solvent (water). Thus, the boiling point of a solution is always higher than that of the boiling point of the pure solvent in which the solution is prepared as shown in Fig. 1.7. Similar to lowering of vapour pressure, the elevation of boiling point also depends on the number of solute molecules rather than their nature. A solution of $1 \\ m 0 1$ of sucrose in $1 0 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of water boils at $3 7 3 . 5 2 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ at one atmospheric pressure. \n\nLet $T _ { \\mathrm { b } } ^ { 0 }$ be the boiling point of pure solvent and $T _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ be the boiling point of solution. The increase in the boiling point $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } } = T _ { \\mathrm { b } } - T _ { \\mathrm { b } } ^ { 0 }$ is known as elevation of boiling point. \n\nExperiments have shown that for dilute solutions the elevation of boiling point $( \\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } } )$ is directly proportional to the molal concentration of the solute in a solution. Thus \n\nHere $m$ (molality) is the number of moles of solute dissolved in $1 ~ \\mathrm { k g }$ of solvent and the constant of proportionality, $K _ { \\mathrm { { b } } }$ is called Boiling Point Elevation Constant or Molal Elevation Constant (Ebullioscopic Constant).

We know that at the freezing point of a substance, the solid phase is in dynamic equilibrium with the liquid phase. Thus, the freezing point of a substance may be defined as the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the substance in its liquid phase is equal to its vapour pressure in the solid phase. A solution will freeze when its vapour pressure equals the vapour pressure of the pure solid solvent as is clear from Fig. 1.8. According to Raoult's law, when a non-volatile solid is added to the solvent its vapour pressure decreases and now it would become equal to that of solid solvent at lower temperature. Thus, the freezing point of the solvent decreases. \n\nLet $T _ { \\mathrm { f } } ^ { 0 }$ be the freezing point", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-b142a515c4e225da54e241e0f3b8b8ef", "__created_at__": 1762850509, "content": "solution will freeze when its vapour pressure equals the vapour pressure of the pure solid solvent as is clear from Fig. 1.8.

These membranes can be of animal or vegetable origin and these occur naturally such as pig's bladder or parchment or can be synthetic such as cellophane. These membranes appear to be continuous sheets or films, yet they contain a network of submicroscopic holes or pores. Small solvent \n\nmolecules, like water, can pass through these holes but the passage of bigger molecules like solute is hindered. Membranes having this kind of properties are known as semipermeable membranes (SPM). \n\nAssume that only solvent molecules can pass through these semipermeable membranes. If this membrane is placed between the solvent and solution as shown in Fig. 1.9, the solvent molecules will flow through the membrane from pure solvent to the solution. This process of flow of the solvent is called osmosis. \n\nThe flow will continue till the equilibrium is attained. The flow of the solvent from its side to solution side across a semipermeable membrane can be stopped if some extra pressure is applied on the solution. This pressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called osmotic pressure of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to the concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to osmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules always flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution. The osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration of the solution. \n\nThe osmotic pressure of a solution is the excess pressure that must be applied to a solution to prevent osmosis, i.e., to stop the passage of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane into the solution. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.10. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property as it depends on the number of solute molecules and not on their identity. For dilute solutions, it has been found experimentally that osmotic pressure is proportional to the molarity, $\\pmb { c }$ of the solution at a given temperature $\\pmb { T }$ Thus: \n\nHere $\\Pi$ is the osmotic pressure and $\\mathrm { R }$ is the gas constant. \n\nHere $V$ is volume of a solution in litres containing $\\mathbf { n } _ { 2 }$ moles of solute. If $\\mathbf { w } _ { 2 }$ grams of solute, of molar mass, $M _ { 2 }$ is present in the solution, then $n _ { 2 } = \\mathrm { w } _ { 2 } \\ / \\ M _ { 2 }$ and we can write, \n\nThus, knowing the quantities $\\mathbf { w } _ { 2 }$ , $T , \\Pi$ and $V$ we can calculate the molar mass of the solute. \n\nMeasurement of osmotic pressure provides another method of determining molar masses of solutes. This method is widely used to determine molar masses of proteins, polymers and other macromolecules. The osmotic pressure method has the advantage over other methods as pressure measurement is around the room temperature and the molarity of the solution is used instead of molality. As compared to other colligative properties, its magnitude is large even for very dilute solutions. The technique of osmotic pressure for determination of molar mass of solutes is particularly useful for biomolecules as they are generally not stable at higher temperatures and polymers have poor solubility. \n\nTwo solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given temperature are called isotonic solutions. When such solutions are separated by semipermeable membrane no osmosis occurs between them. For example, the osmotic pressure associated with the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/volume) sodium chloride", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-43ef3a8613d50ee87bf60435c51e2ef5", "__created_at__": 1762850509, "content": "molar mass of solutes is particularly useful for biomolecules as they are generally not stable at higher temperatures and polymers have poor solubility. \n\nTwo solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given temperature are called isotonic solutions. When such solutions are separated by semipermeable membrane no osmosis occurs between them. For example, the osmotic pressure associated with the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/volume) sodium chloride solution, called normal saline solution and it is safe to inject intravenously. On the other hand, if we place the cells in a solution containing more than $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/ volume) sodium chloride, water will flow out of the cells and they would shrink. Such a solution is called hypertonic. If the salt concentration is less than $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/volume), the solution is said to be hypotonic. In this case, water will flow into the cells if placed in this solution and they would swell. • \n\nExample 1.11 \n\n$2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m ^ { 3 } }$ of an aqueous solution of a protein contains $1 . 2 6 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of the protein.

A raw mango placed in concentrated salt solution loses water via osmosis and shrivel into pickle. Wilted flowers revive when placed in fresh water. A carrot that has become limp because of water loss into the atmosphere can be placed into the water making it firm once again. Water will move into its cells through osmosis. When placed in water containing less than $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/ volume) salt, blood cells swell due to flow of water in them by osmosis. People taking a lot of salt or salty food experience water retention in tissue cells and intercellular spaces because of osmosis. The resulting puffiness or swelling is called edema. Water movement from soil into plant roots and subsequently into upper portion of the plant is partly due to osmosis. The preservation of meat by salting and of fruits by adding sugar protects against bacterial action. Through the process of osmosis, a bacterium on salted meat or candid fruit loses water, shrivels and dies. \n\n1.6.5 Reverse Osmosis and water Purification \n\nThe direction of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure larger than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution side. That is, now the pure solvent flows out of the solution through the semi permeable membrane. This phenomenon is called reverse osmosis and is of great practical utility. Reverse osmosis is used in desalination of sea water. A schematic set up for the process is shown in Fig. 1.11. \n\nWhen pressure more than osmotic pressure is applied, pure water is squeezed out of the sea water through the membrane. A variety of polymer membranes are available for this purpose. \n\nThe pressure required for the reverse osmosis is quite high. A workable porous membrane is a film of cellulose acetate placed over a suitable support. Cellulose acetate is permeable to water but impermeable to impurities and ions present in sea water.

This normally happens in solvents of low dielectric constant. In this case the number of particles is reduced due to dimerisation. Association of molecules is depicted as follows: \n\nIt can be undoubtedly stated here that if all the molecules of ethanoic acid associate in benzene, then $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ or $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ for ethanoic acid will be half of the normal value. The molar mass calculated on the basis of this $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ or $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ will, therefore, be twice the expected value. Such a molar mass that is either lower or higher than the expected or normal value is called as abnormal molar mass. \n\nIn l880 van't Hoff introduced a factor i, known as the van't Hoff factor, to account for the extent of dissociation or association. This factor i is defined as: - \n\nNormal molar mass Abnormal molar mass blis Observed colligative property Calculated colligative property i Total number of moles of particles after association/dissociation Number of moles of particles before association/dissociation \n\nHere abnormal molar mass is the experimentally determined molar mass and calculated colligative properties are obtained by assuming that the non-volatile solute is neither associated nor dissociated. In case of association, value of i is less than unity while for dissociation it is greater than unity. For example, the value of i for aqueous KCl solution is close to 2, while the value for ethanoic acid in benzene is nearly 0.5. \n\nInclusion of van't Hoff factor modifies the equations for colligative properties as follows: \n\nRelative lowering of vapour pressure of solvent, \n\nElevation of Boiling point, $\\Delta T _ { b } ^ { \\mathrm { ~ = ~ } i \\mathrm { ~ } K _ { b } }$ m Depression of Freezing point, $\\Delta T _ { f } = \\ i \\ K _ { f } \\ \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ Osmotic pressure of solution, $\\Pi \\ = \\ i \\ n _ { 2 } \\ R \\ T \\ / \\ V$ \n\nTable 1.4 depicts values of the factor, i for several strong electrolytes.

Solutions are classified as solid, liquid and gaseous solutions. The concentration of a solution is expressed in terms of mole fraction, molarity, molality and in percentages. The dissolution of a gas in a liquid is governed by Henry's law, according to which, at a given temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas. The vapour pressure of the solvent is lowered by the presence of a non-volatile solute in the solution and this lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent is governed by Raoult's law, according to which the relative lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent over a solution is equal to the mole fraction of a non-volatile solute present in the solution. However, in a binary liquid solution, if both the components of the solution are volatile then another form of Raoult's law is used. Mathematically, this form of the Raoult's law is stated as: $p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } } = p _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } ^ { \\mathrm { 0 } } x _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } + p _ { \\mathrm { 2 } } ^ { \\mathrm { 0 } } x _ { \\mathrm { 2 } }$ .

Solutions which obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration are called ideal solutions. Two types of deviations from Raoult's law, called positive and negative deviations are observed. Azeotropes arise due to very large deviations from Raoult's law. \n\nThe properties of solutions which depend on the number of solute particles and are independent of their chemical identity are called colligative properties. These are lowering of vapour pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point and osmotic pressure. The process of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure higher than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution. Colligative properties have been used to determine the molar mass of solutes. Solutes which dissociate in solution exhibit molar mass lower than the actual molar mass and those which associate show higher molar mass than their actual values. \n\nQuantitatively, the extent to which a solute is dissociated or associated can be expressed by van't Hoff factor i.

It categorizes solutions into three main types: Gaseous Solutions, Liquid Solutions, and Solid Solutions, each with subcategories based on the physical states of solute and solvent. For Gaseous Solutions, examples include mixtures like oxygen and nitrogen gases (gas in gas), chloroform mixed with nitrogen gas (liquid in gas), and camphor in nitrogen gas (solid in gas). Liquid Solutions include oxygen dissolved in water (gas in liquid) and ethanol or glucose dissolved in water (liquid or solid in liquid). Solid Solutions examples are hydrogen in palladium (gas in solid) and amalgams like mercury with sodium or copper dissolved in gold (solid in solid). The table illustrates the diversity of binary solutions by showing how solutes and solvents of different states combine, supporting the surrounding content's explanation of solution types and their formation. It emphasizes the concept that solutions are homogeneous mixtures with uniform properties, and the examples link directly to real-life applications such as gas mixtures in the atmosphere, aqueous solutions, and metal alloys. The table also implicitly supports the discussion on expressing concentration by showing the physical states involved, which influence how concentration units like mass percentage or mole fraction are applied. The presence of multiple states in solute and solvent combinations highlights the complexity and variety of solutions studied in the unit, reinforcing the foundational knowledge necessary for understanding solution properties and concentration expressions.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-ca80e5b47c2e1f040a1db3774f40f7a5", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'Chemistry ', 'bbox': [102, 901, 239, 915], 'page_idx': 1}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of the single word 'Chemistry' positioned on page 1, with no additional context or elaboration.

Here, $n_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $n_{\\mathrm{B}}$ represent the number of moles of components A and B respectively. The mole fraction $x_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is a dimensionless quantity representing the ratio of moles of A to the total moles in the solution. This equation employs basic arithmetic operations of addition and division. It is fundamental in solution chemistry for quantitatively describing composition, especially when dealing with mixtures of two components. The mole fraction is crucial in thermodynamics and physical chemistry, as it directly relates to properties such as vapor pressure, colligative properties, and chemical potential.

Mathematically, molarity is given by M = n / V, where n represents the amount of solute in moles, and V is the total volume of the solution in liters. This ratio quantifies how many moles of solute are present per liter of solution, enabling precise stoichiometric calculations. The variables are: 'Moles of solute' (n), which is the amount of substance measured in moles, and 'Volume of solution in litre' (V), the total solution volume including solute and solvent. The operation is a simple division, reflecting a density-like measure of solute concentration. Molarity is widely used in analytical chemistry, solution preparation, and reaction stoichiometry, especially where volume measurements are convenient.

Here, molarity is computed by dividing the amount of solute in moles (0.125 mol) multiplied by the conversion factor from milliliters to liters (1000 mL/L) by the volume of the solution in milliliters (450 mL). The resulting value, 0.278 mol/L, quantifies the concentration of NaOH in the solution. Variables include the moles of solute (0.125 mol), volume of solution (450 mL), and the unit conversion factor (1000 mL/L). The operations involve multiplication and division, converting volume units and calculating molarity. This equation is situated in the context of solution concentration units, illustrating how molarity relates to other concentration measures like mass percent and mole fraction. Molarity is temperature-dependent due to volume changes, distinguishing it from mass-based concentration units. The equation's physical significance lies in its use for preparing and characterizing chemical solutions, essential in laboratory and industrial processes. It connects to broader discussions on solution concentration by providing a precise, volumetric-based measure, facilitating stoichiometric calculations and reaction planning. Practical applications include chemical synthesis, pharmaceutical formulation, and analytical chemistry, where accurate concentration knowledge is critical.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-0fabbe7659996876a15fd809d89cd0df", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'Chemistry 士', 'bbox': [100, 901, 244, 917], 'page_idx': 3}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of the text 'Chemistry 士' located on page 3 with bounding box coordinates [100, 901, 244, 917].

Mathematically, molality is given by m = n_solute / m_solvent, where n_solute represents the amount of solute in moles, calculated by dividing the mass of the solute by its molar mass, and m_solvent is the mass of the solvent in kilograms. This ratio is a concentration measure independent of temperature and pressure since it relies on mass rather than volume. The equation involves fundamental operations of division and unit conversion (grams to kilograms). In the context of solution chemistry, molality is crucial for expressing solution concentration, especially when temperature variations affect volume but not mass. It complements other concentration measures such as molarity and mole fraction, providing a stable parameter for colligative property calculations and thermodynamic analyses. The equation's theoretical significance lies in its role in quantifying solute concentration relative to solvent mass, facilitating precise stoichiometric and physical property predictions in chemical solutions. Practically, it is used in preparing solutions with specific properties, studying freezing point depression, boiling point elevation, and vapor pressure lowering. Within the broader framework of solution concentration expressions, this equation highlights the importance of mass-based concentration metrics in chemical and physical chemistry.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-d5b83cd898ca42031da3627556c0414d", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'J Solutions ', 'bbox': [762, 901, 897, 915], 'page_idx': 4}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of the text 'J Solutions' located on page 4, with no additional explanatory or contextual information.

It is divided into two main parts labeled (a) and (b), illustrating the effect of pressure on gas solubility in a liquid. Part (a) shows a container with two distinct regions: the lower region contains a liquid solution, and the upper region contains a gas phase at pressure p and temperature T. The gas phase is depicted with scattered gas molecules above the liquid surface, indicating a state of dynamic equilibrium where the rate of gas molecules entering and leaving the solution is balanced. Part (b) shows the same container but with the gas phase compressed to a smaller volume, increasing the gas pressure above the solution. This is visually represented by a higher density of gas molecules in the upper region, indicating increased pressure. The diagram uses arrows to show the movement of gas molecules between the gas phase and the liquid solution, emphasizing the dynamic exchange process. The color scheme is simple and functional, using blue to represent the liquid solution and gray or white for the gas molecules and container. The lighting is flat and schematic, typical of educational scientific illustrations. The visual style is clean and minimalistic, focusing on clarity and conceptual explanation rather than artistic detail. This diagram directly relates to the surrounding text discussing Henry's law and the relationship between gas pressure and solubility, visually reinforcing the concept that increasing gas pressure increases gas solubility in a liquid until a new equilibrium is established.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "eJwBAAP//DSuy6J2qWImTTFlKQgwEC2ELyuuH6snIQKqsStTIiat2SiNqyKwr6VXMNSs7B1eLmitBjAGLc8uWy69JR6pdB60KzQqCic1rLguEC1GrPQtWq47r96kJTFlJRgvyShFKS6xVazFss+iIbOCpY4pkC96nDiuhqgerxopLzGjKd8wMi45qDkwOZihqPCqnK/wK4Qtr5VXJV+sgKf3GxipkiX7KS4mIa6ZLTG0Hac4GaixyyNisR2srit4r0wZQy0Voi8v7qzNLQcrQJS0qB0t3q9krPCwTC1CMMEqKDDKHVijVqx3pUKtwin6r1KkEK6hKFQto6q7sOueESjCGDOZAABQn7KwUi0GLx6qlaD2rKCsT6thLlinmyoNrWYxIbN/sUStMDEErLirQa/cLiwmkLAmJxwts6pGpY4hrKRVLagvTrKUo+SxVKyPquCwpy4qr/+vpC4ZKBwsDqggKA+sX6ANrQGpUqilJO0t4aglKsgiSCXLnNStmShAq7gwLR0apsOTZy1Ps1klSzNMsAuwWSt2LhOgr6mor64wqCoCqoqpl69/su4aIK42skGtFqQNrR0mVKmZpoOwYSqxqZ4xAIACKECLCrS+L9cwDSm5JrisaC0Xr3updC0QIcmlM6+ppg0oByceKuAr9K7eLSmsvK0MqnUrZi7GKdarCigLLY6uR6SjIdoiWK8lLWixVKiTFz8iaK1PLjGqPKWHMwY0X7PJKA8k8C1zrEcsFyL3LN0nT7DWKnWbnjBGLG8rqSb5DkiuYrKcrKathjH8q68taqfeMoQsmzBtrdswNJ5Ts1moDbB4IGKuuSyzoB8iLa2mrr0ZEquXpjkuFKS3LgkyAoAhK8imXixFrZOkwjFAMJEr2KRsKawvbS3aLtSxvqD6LNaxOq/qodowxibbr9Em5qxPKtomhSzlKr6pYyUAKMYtRyzdLaQuxqc/sYUxKautKp0fw6pyrmWrojE3MVWwIzGPrrYua7ABMPabRS/FMAelvq3uMwMstSgkJ4kycKyBnn05SxY="}, {"__id__": "chunk-3643fbab1144222de5b691a9d2a33f6e", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "\nImage Content Analysis:\nImage Path: /workspace/RAG-System-Chemistry/output/lech101/auto/images/39d98aa97939d54977470f2d30257ae18087f8adbb9a77645cb25e9dbf145e04.jpg\nCaptions: None\nFootnotes: None\n\nVisual Analysis: The image is a two-dimensional graph illustrating the experimental results for the solubility of hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas in cyclohexane at a temperature of 293 K. The graph is plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system with the x-axis labeled as the mole fraction of HCl gas in the solution and the y-axis labeled as the partial pressure of HCl gas in bar. The x-axis values range from 0 to approximately 0.0006, indicating very low mole fractions, while the y-axis values range from 0 to 0.06 bar. A series of discrete data points are plotted on the graph, each represented by small black dots. These points form a linear trend ascending from the origin towards the upper right corner of the graph, demonstrating a direct proportionality between the mole fraction and the partial pressure. A straight line is drawn through the data points, representing the best fit or trend line, which confirms Henry's law that the partial pressure of a gas above a solution is proportional to its mole fraction in the solution. The slope of this line corresponds to the Henry's law constant (K_H) for HCl gas in cyclohexane at 293 K. The graph is cleanly designed with clear axis labels and a title at the top reading \"Fig. 1.2: Experimental results for the solubility of HCl gas in cyclohexane at 293 K.\" The background is white, and the graph lines and text are in black, providing high contrast and readability. The visual style is scientific and formal, typical of textbook or academic publication figures. This graph visually supports the surrounding text's explanation of Henry's law and the relationship between gas solubility and partial pressure, providing empirical evidence for the proportionality constant and reinforcing the concept that solubility depends on the nature of the gas and solvent as well as temperature.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-d3bd6806c852091dadc4eb7c0e5adc2c", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\np = K _ { \\mathrm { H } } \\ x\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: The equation p = K_H x represents Henry's law, which quantitatively relates the partial pressure p of a gas above a liquid to the mole fraction x of the gas dissolved in the liquid at equilibrium and constant temperature. Here, p denotes the partial pressure of the gas in the vapor phase, x is the mole fraction of the gas dissolved in the solvent, and K_H is Henry's law constant, a proportionality factor dependent on the nature of the gas and temperature. Mathematically, this is a linear relationship indicating direct proportionality between gas solubility and its partial pressure. The equation involves simple multiplication, reflecting a first-order dependence without higher-order or nonlinear terms. In the context of gas solubility in liquids, this law is fundamental for understanding how gases dissolve under varying pressures, especially in aqueous solutions. Physically, it embodies the dynamic equilibrium between gas molecules entering and leaving the solution, governed by molecular interactions and thermodynamic principles. The constant K_H encapsulates the affinity of the gas for the solvent and varies with temperature, typically increasing with temperature, which corresponds to decreased solubility. This equation is closely related to concepts of dynamic equilibrium, partial pressure, mole fraction, and thermodynamic solubility. Practically, it is applied in environmental science (e.g., oxygen solubility in water sustaining aquatic life), industrial processes (carbonation of beverages), and physiological contexts (scuba diving gas absorption). Within the broader framework of solubility phenomena, this equation complements the discussion on how temperature and pressure influence solubility, specifically highlighting the distinct behavior of gases compared to solids in liquids.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-d9462edbc88444466028a709278760a8", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'Reprint 2025-26 ', 'bbox': [447, 973, 550, 983], 'page_idx': 6}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of a brief text snippet 'Reprint 2025-26' located on page 6, positioned near the bottom of the page as indicated by the bounding box coordinates.

The left side lists gases such as Helium (He), Hydrogen (H_2), Nitrogen (N_2), and Oxygen (O_2) at temperatures 293 K and 303 K, while the right side lists Argon, Carbon Dioxide (CO_2), Formaldehyde, Methane, and Vinyl chloride at 298 K or 298-299 K. The Henry's law constant (K_H) quantifies the proportionality between the partial pressure of a gas and its mole fraction in solution, with higher K_H values indicating lower solubility.\n\nKey data points include: Helium has a high K_H of 144.97 kbar at 293 K, indicating low solubility; Nitrogen's K_H increases from 76.48 kbar at 293 K to 88.84 kbar at 303 K, showing decreased solubility with temperature rise; Oxygen's K_H increases from 34.86 kbar at 293 K to 46.82 kbar at 303 K, consistent with the temperature effect; CO_2 has a very low K_H of 1.67 kbar at 298 K, indicating high solubility; Formaldehyde and Methane have extremely low K_H values (1.83×10^-5 and 0.413-0.611 kbar respectively), suggesting very high solubility.\n\nStatistical trends reveal that for diatomic gases like N_2 and O_2, K_H increases with temperature, confirming the inverse relationship between solubility and temperature. The variation in K_H among gases at similar temperatures reflects the influence of gas nature on solubility, supporting the text's assertion that K_H depends on gas identity. The table's data directly supports the surrounding content's explanation of Henry's law, illustrating how different gases dissolve in water under varying temperatures and pressures.\n\nThe relationship between temperature and K_H values in the table exemplifies the exothermic nature of gas dissolution, as higher temperatures reduce solubility (higher K_H). This explains biological phenomena such as aquatic species' preference for cold water and the medical implications for scuba divers due to gas solubility changes with pressure and temperature. The table also underpins industrial applications like carbonation of soft drinks and the use of helium in diving tanks to mitigate nitrogen toxicity.\n\nOverall, the table concretely illustrates Henry's law constants for various gases, reinforcing the theoretical concepts and practical examples discussed in the surrounding text about gas solubility, temperature effects, and pressure relationships in aqueous solutions.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-bc507e212db27612561273ad0ec9c4a0", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\nx \\ : { \\mathrm { ( N i t r o g e n ) } } \\ : = \\ : { \\frac { p \\ : { \\mathrm { ( n i t r o g e n ) } } } { K _ { \\mathrm { H } } } } \\ : = \\ : { \\frac { 0 . 9 8 7 { \\mathrm { b a r } } } { 7 6 . 4 8 0 { \\mathrm { b a r } } } } = 1 . 2 9 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: This equation represents Henry's law expressed mathematically for nitrogen gas dissolved in water. It states that the mole fraction x of nitrogen gas in the aqueous solution is equal to the ratio of the partial pressure p of nitrogen gas above the solution to Henry's law constant K_H for nitrogen at the given temperature. Here, x is the mole fraction of nitrogen in the liquid phase (dimensionless), p is the partial pressure of nitrogen gas in bar, and K_H is Henry's law constant in bar, characterizing the solubility of nitrogen in water at 293 K. The equation uses a simple division operation to relate gas phase pressure to solubility in the liquid phase, reflecting a direct proportionality between solubility and partial pressure. This formulation is fundamental in physical chemistry and chemical engineering for quantifying gas solubility in liquids under equilibrium conditions. The constant K_H depends on temperature and the nature of the gas, indicating that solubility decreases with increasing temperature for nitrogen. The equation is applied in contexts such as calculating dissolved gas amounts in water, understanding aquatic life conditions, and industrial processes involving gas-liquid equilibria. It connects to broader concepts of gas solubility, partial pressures, and equilibrium thermodynamics, and serves as a basis for practical applications like carbonation of beverages, scuba diving safety, and environmental science. The numerical example demonstrates how to compute the mole fraction from known pressure and Henry's constant, illustrating the quantitative use of Henry's law in real-world scenarios.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-5e624bf0716a7ecb2165456122a77f95", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'Chemistry ', 'bbox': [102, 901, 243, 915], 'page_idx': 7}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of the single word 'Chemistry' positioned on page 7, with no additional context or elaboration.

Mathematically, it states that the partial vapor pressure (p_2) of component 2 above the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction (x_2) in the liquid phase, with the proportionality constant being the vapor pressure of the pure component 2 (p_2^0) at the same temperature. Here, p_2 is the partial vapor pressure of component 2 in the solution, p_2^0 is the vapor pressure of pure component 2, and x_2 is the mole fraction of component 2 in the liquid solution. The operation involved is a simple scalar multiplication reflecting linear proportionality. This equation is fundamental in physical chemistry and solution thermodynamics, describing how the composition of a liquid mixture affects the vapor pressures of its constituents. It is applied in contexts such as distillation, solvent evaporation, and understanding solution volatility. The equation relates to Dalton's law of partial pressures, which states that total vapor pressure is the sum of partial pressures, and to the broader framework of Raoult's law which applies to ideal solutions. Physically, it signifies that the presence of a solute reduces the escaping tendency of solvent molecules proportionally to their mole fraction. Practically, it helps predict vapor-liquid equilibria, design separation processes, and analyze solution behavior under varying compositions.

Mathematically, it expresses the total vapor pressure (p_total) as a linear combination of the partial vapor pressures of the two components, weighted by their mole fractions in the liquid phase. Here, x_1 and x_2 denote the mole fractions of components 1 and 2 respectively, with the constraint x_1 + x_2 = 1. The terms p_1^0 and p_2^0 represent the vapor pressures of the pure components 1 and 2 at the same temperature. The equation is derived by substituting p_1 = x_1 p_1^0 and p_2 = x_2 p_2^0 into Dalton's law of partial pressures, yielding p_total = x_1 p_1^0 + x_2 p_2^0. Re-expressing x_1 as (1 - x_2) leads to the linear form p_total = p_1^0 + (p_2^0 - p_1^0) x_2, highlighting the linear dependence of total vapor pressure on the mole fraction of component 2. This linearity is fundamental in physical chemistry for understanding solution behavior, phase equilibria, and volatility. The equation applies in contexts such as predicting vapor pressures in liquid mixtures, designing distillation processes, and analyzing solution thermodynamics. It also connects to Dalton's and Henry's laws, illustrating the interplay between mole fractions and partial pressures.

The graph features three distinct lines plotted on a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. The x-axis represents the mole fraction of component 2 (x2), ranging from 0 to 1, while the y-axis represents vapour pressure, presumably in mm Hg or a similar unit, with values increasing upwards. The graph includes two dashed lines labeled I and II, which represent the partial vapour pressures of the two components in the binary solution. Line I starts at a higher vapour pressure value on the y-axis when x2 is 0 and decreases linearly to zero as x2 approaches 1, indicating the partial pressure of component 1 (p1) is proportional to its mole fraction (x1 = 1 - x2). Line II starts at zero vapour pressure when x2 is 0 and increases linearly to a higher vapour pressure value as x2 reaches 1, representing the partial pressure of component 2 (p2) proportional to its mole fraction (x2). A third solid line, labeled III, lies between the two dashed lines and represents the total vapour pressure (p_total) of the solution, which varies linearly with the mole fraction of component 2. The total vapour pressure line starts at the vapour pressure of pure component 1 (p1^0) when x2 is 0 and ends at the vapour pressure of pure component 2 (p2^0) when x2 is 1. The graph visually demonstrates Raoult's law, showing that the partial vapour pressures of each component are directly proportional to their mole fractions in the solution, and the total vapour pressure is the sum of these partial pressures. The background is white with black axes and lines, and the dashed lines are clearly distinguishable from the solid total pressure line. The graph is clean, with no additional colors or shading, emphasizing clarity and scientific accuracy. This visual element directly supports the surrounding text discussing the vapour pressure of liquid-liquid solutions, Raoult's law, and the linear relationship between mole fractions and vapour pressures in ideal binary solutions.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-e62348071776f834c98920aa2088fa66", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'Reprint 2025-26 ', 'bbox': [447, 973, 550, 983], 'page_idx': 9}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of a brief text snippet 'Reprint 2025-26' located on page 9, with no additional explanatory or contextual information.

Here, p_i denotes the partial pressure of component i, y_i is the mole fraction of component i in the vapor phase, and p_total is the total vapor pressure above the solution. Mathematically, this is a direct application of Dalton's law of partial pressures, which states that the total pressure exerted by a gaseous mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of each individual component. The mole fraction y_i serves as a weighting factor indicating the proportion of component i in the vapor phase. This linear relationship implies that the partial pressure of each component is proportional to its mole fraction in the vapor. The equation is fundamental in thermodynamics and physical chemistry for describing phase equilibria, particularly vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE). It connects the composition of the vapor phase to measurable pressures, enabling the determination of vapor phase composition from total pressure and vice versa. This equation complements Raoult's law, which relates the partial pressure of a component to its mole fraction in the liquid phase and the pure component vapor pressure. Together, these laws allow calculation of vapor pressures and compositions in binary or multicomponent solutions, as illustrated in the surrounding context with chloroform and dichloromethane mixtures. The physical significance lies in predicting how volatile components distribute between liquid and vapor phases, critical for distillation, solvent recovery, and chemical process design. The equation also underpins the understanding that the vapor phase is richer in the more volatile component, as the mole fraction y_i in vapor reflects volatility differences. Overall, this equation is a cornerstone in the quantitative description of vapor-liquid equilibria and is essential for practical applications in chemical engineering, environmental science, and materials processing.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "eJwFwX1sS1sAAPCamTExSho87dauH7f3nnPubbt4LHjbk7EJQVZGjNQWyWI+YgnJEOl74uuPZYK32N5KVdv7dc65px3LRERCwjYRRLo/RLIxgk0sUSTD8Ps9kU86G7ha9aH/R3y9BLgqf41eROKp+bg9esF1HueCXtRHFqIvYB4XYadAIRnw2SPPwXP0I1bt2QW/GBXCSMyBl+KcrpDxGGVYWPo3vbx0Awnz+/XpaF/Ukizjo2h1d78vRvZqEf0wsCjvunac3eyz4Z2aSXqAo8hseaL/Q1rZCXAG3lXz+ULQdvGclwOtTou3xlejDWhWcl+Z4IpIyP/JMLN6eI9y6nfpWUkOaBFHpI2Jj1eq9Busmb5c/LA4JP6U/3LzsJ1V8z1iFE8VB+lpHBQ63PPpL/1P3Kns5rfo/cpBYDJ9VSCmYI/UR9fwGa2Zc5I+z98LskZjehiW4wZULu8XRx3ryCnSBI9o5WDrtZWzslqP9Tipi1bwh4S4aydRjKlSf7IJnABhJV8dBoPix1QJa1EH2SpoWvSejnUnPfIfH6IT9JFvDFnl87RAYWnOtyw2W6twu4qvMsi7pDjdmhowqsRfuMzuYcOohN4CTC1gQ3yvs4zVpmzpqNIrD2kR+MztZUOgV017TeFR/FqpT7aJb12f3WZSS3LxJtlwKcli2i98oFNKO7mQWCBecpo7sqIKRi5bWF0qKB7gergVXpP7zP8vItR6Lw+z43A2zeD6RKizUYdgtPtQpCFwNJBNZ3wXlNxAdccrdbef0x90Nqdt0IvM7kYo808T5mvb8R0aZgIYD+D0qhLbtGDpuO2R3EXq0KSRj4OOjaRYek3zEm7yuLVlXkY6iMesn/PWOi8WNfG3xJxwqcuqf4PH6Bu6RDwHDHBSCPon0Lh9qcNJJtUy1INrtTrHTe9RYE+OOdoS//llm5M7rQS7Gn0wnhXnMoHM0Yc5u1IJNhgzk9CznS7T6eJ6/zb0Es9ATUazB5Ah2CFUCoFLk8SRWiAdEwuvX0WHuduxdvobo7RYhQ=="}, {"__id__": "chunk-97a565fb29191dc7fe7cfa41dfe02b9e", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\n\\mathrm { M o l e s \\ o f \\ C H _ { 2 } C l _ { 2 } } \\qquad = \\ { \\frac { 4 0 \\ \\mathrm { g } } { 8 5 \\ \\mathrm { g \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } } } } \\ = \\ 0 . 4 7 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: This equation calculates the number of moles of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) present in a given mass of 40 grams by dividing the mass by the molar mass (85 g/mol).

Here, p_1^0 and p_2^0 denote the vapor pressures of pure components 1 and 2 respectively at a given temperature, and x_2 is the mole fraction of component 2 in the liquid phase. The equation uses basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, and multiplication, reflecting the linear dependence of total vapor pressure on composition.

Here, p denotes the partial vapor pressure of the gas component in the solution, x is the mole fraction of the gas dissolved in the liquid phase, and K_H is Henry's law constant, a proportionality factor characteristic of the specific gas-liquid system at a given temperature. The equation is linear, indicating that the gas solubility in the liquid is directly proportional to its partial pressure in the vapor phase. This relationship is fundamental in physical chemistry and chemical engineering for describing gas solubility equilibria. In the surrounding context, Henry's law is discussed alongside Raoult's law, highlighting that Raoult's law is a special case of Henry's law where the proportionality constant K_H equals the vapor pressure of the pure component (p_i^0). The equation is significant in understanding vapor-liquid equilibria, especially for volatile components and gas solubility in liquids, and is applied in calculating vapor pressures and mole fractions in vapor phases of solutions. It also underpins the theoretical framework for ideal and non-ideal solution behavior, influencing practical applications such as distillation, solvent extraction, and environmental modeling of gas absorption.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "eJwNyXdIVGEAAPDLysIKGo40Lz313b3xfe++510qSXUVSQuyZetKJZQSmjaJyiTKoKmlZufI83lvfN8bd1eYRGFWREaDBqGZDaIijBYVVFa/f3+TjH52n7RpIp2+nqLQHeiC7XoJF0Vy9LkpmbZGLQp0cL1aCp/NReJLEuN8RALCCbaIscEudhueMzFJrbVmIC++Rvcz2cQKt4oDE+r1PqHJEdd6Tjzi3CwPllgyEyWGu/lFtiq8VMlF7TiLrQNRrlpckEjRd/FDOFRxa1ZfdniFfyw/yf8s8RU1Tm9r6EnmYCb9KXm5cVq3mTbym7mozHL3mBeNKj3WWEP2IprazXeBZnimsYR8kVzyCPJSbbMVMBUJv0EugqHVbDmzsK5Y+Cq/FKeqbWqM3M2OIBXRpdy3ZmdTkLNYprSW4QLBSi1TD+OrxI8fyZHwbEM02W/Gs3ONg+lEreUF2iSr6kbCHuIFM3yJ4kfDY59uzW2xgWugiQxoPnPj/2t2FCJZfaPOBvFCjxlhFkrLDa/DndZlRhiZcrG9km23p7Ib+FvsIuLlNGM8H+vYTo0dXilmhXzgNVMcnG8oUogJkD1qfXBfusPp5p82hIwlygD3R/sRHBTMIvF+UWniMuwx5AP0iAnIUlbC3ram+Q6zD6gXzgdwgcPjzzM+ks/JIbq2Zhd+Bw9Q93gNlAsBVQRblFKjlSwwj/IuaDE9TCeYLbPaDdwPd5gWdpSaoXYMOW0fo12HFeYc+qfL674dGiZc8S10fZcZphBF4Mv84lApmqB0gVVplczxlgruuX7EPB8qQlgYGX5rpfEpN4PeJUmyCjpbovR5cWu1dUgNYvJZeSV3oNHysfqVeo54KECSV/LvYUTZjLRY3O3sk1L1vYIXxDHL7I+FUlANb4IwyTdWax7zpLQr6QLMc1pJGSA4z1XkKIdn1XP6RpAqp8AcnMqfdCTg40k+NNk4FfA5P5BqNV/blt7veoKnC79aLwCD1KD7/kb5C9oZ2KlPc6dwXDgS/RXsdK/4D3ukUvo="}, {"__id__": "chunk-bb576c51c54798e96d6e70625855d698", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "\nImage Content Analysis:\nImage Path: /workspace/RAG-System-Chemistry/output/lech101/auto/images/e7f30d73d09fa3103076659add69ba4083f318eb2f921b64d59f106bfdc67f37.jpg\nCaptions: None\nFootnotes: None\n\nVisual Analysis: The image is a two-part schematic diagram labeled as Fig. 1.4, illustrating the decrease in vapour pressure of a solvent due to the presence of a solute. The layout is horizontal with two side-by-side panels labeled (a) and (b). Panel (a) depicts a pure solvent surface where only solvent molecules are present. These solvent molecules are represented as small solid circles densely packed at the surface, with some molecules shown escaping upwards, indicated by open circles (O) above the surface, symbolizing evaporation. The background is plain, emphasizing the molecular arrangement at the surface. Panel (b) shows a solution where solute particles, represented by larger open circles with a smaller circle inside (\\textcircled{\\circ}), occupy part of the surface area alongside the solvent molecules (solid circles). The surface is thus partially covered by solute particles, reducing the area available for solvent molecules. Correspondingly, fewer solvent molecules are shown escaping from the surface compared to panel (a), visually conveying the reduction in vapour pressure. The color scheme is simple, using black and white with clear symbolic shapes to differentiate solvent and solute particles. The lighting is uniform with no shading, consistent with a schematic style. The image directly relates to the surrounding text explaining how the addition of a non-volatile solute reduces the vapour pressure of the solvent by decreasing the surface area available for solvent evaporation. This visual aid supports the conceptual explanation of Raoult's law and the physical basis for vapour pressure lowering in solutions. The technical style is typical of educational chemistry diagrams, focusing on clarity and conceptual illustration rather than realistic depiction.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-5c354dad386da07354e111a56f7a6288", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'Chemistry 1 ', 'bbox': [102, 901, 241, 915], 'page_idx': 11}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of the text 'Chemistry 1' located on page 11, with no additional context or elaboration.

The graph has a Cartesian coordinate system with the x-axis labeled as 'Mole fraction of solvent (x1)' ranging from 0 to 1, and the y-axis labeled as 'Vapour pressure (p1)' with values increasing upwards. The graph shows a straight line starting from the origin (0,0) and rising linearly to the point where the mole fraction is 1, corresponding to the vapour pressure of the pure solvent (p1^0). This linear plot visually represents the direct proportionality between the vapour pressure of the solvent in the solution and its mole fraction, as stated by Raoult's law. The line is typically drawn in a solid color, likely black or dark, for clear visibility against a white or light background.

Specifically, p_1 = x_1 p_1^0, where p_1^0 is the vapor pressure of the pure solvent. Here, p_1 represents the partial vapor pressure exerted by the solvent molecules in the vapor phase at equilibrium, x_1 is the mole fraction of the solvent in the liquid phase, and p_1^0 is a constant characteristic of the pure solvent at the given temperature. The proportionality reflects the linear dependence of vapor pressure on solvent concentration in ideal solutions, where intermolecular interactions between solvent and solute molecules are similar to those in the pure components. The equation involves basic algebraic operations and proportionality concepts. It is fundamental in physical chemistry and thermodynamics for describing ideal solution behavior, vapor-liquid equilibrium, and colligative properties. The equation serves as a special case of Henry's law when the proportionality constant equals the pure solvent vapor pressure. It underpins the classification of solutions into ideal and non-ideal, and deviations from this law indicate molecular interaction differences leading to positive or negative deviations. Practically, it is used to predict vapor pressures in mixtures, design separation processes like distillation, and understand solution properties in chemical engineering and materials science. Within the broader framework, this equation provides a baseline for analyzing solution behavior, interpreting deviations, and connecting molecular interactions to macroscopic thermodynamic properties.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-5f91bd3841bae12685977e3f5634ae44", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\n\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { m i x } } H = 0 ,\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: The equation \\( \\Delta_{mix} H = 0 \\) mathematically expresses that the enthalpy change upon mixing two or more components to form a solution is zero.

Both graphs share a similar layout with the x-axis representing the mole fraction of component A (ranging from 0 to 1) and the y-axis representing vapour pressure in mm Hg. In Fig. 1.6 (a), the graph depicts a solution exhibiting positive deviation from Raoult's law. The vapour pressure curve is convex, rising above the ideal linear line that connects the vapour pressures of pure components A and B at mole fractions 0 and 1 respectively. This indicates that the vapour pressure of the mixture is higher than predicted by Raoult's law, consistent with weaker A-B intermolecular interactions compared to A-A and B-B interactions. The curve starts at the vapour pressure of pure component B on the left (mole fraction A = 0) and ends at the vapour pressure of pure component A on the right (mole fraction A = 1). In Fig. 1.6 (b), the graph shows a solution with negative deviation from Raoult's law. The vapour pressure curve is concave, lying below the ideal linear line between the pure components' vapour pressures. This indicates stronger A-B interactions than A-A and B-B, resulting in a lower vapour pressure than predicted. Both graphs use solid lines for the actual vapour pressure curves and dashed lines for the ideal linear Raoult's law predictions. The colors used are primarily black for lines and axes, with clear labeling of axes and data points. The visual style is typical of scientific textbook figures, with clean, precise lines and clear typography. The image directly relates to the surrounding text on page 12, which discusses ideal and non-ideal solutions, Raoult's law, and deviations caused by molecular interactions. The graphs visually demonstrate the concepts of positive and negative deviations from Raoult's law, supporting the explanation of molecular interaction effects on vapour pressure in binary liquid mixtures.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-af7968aa42c0f251035ff77460d4f3b7", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'Chemistry ', 'bbox': [102, 901, 239, 915], 'page_idx': 13}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of the single word 'Chemistry' positioned on page 13, with no additional explanatory text or context.

Here, p_1 is the partial vapor pressure of component 1 in the mixture, x_1 is the mole fraction of component 1 in the liquid phase, and p_1^0 is the vapor pressure of pure component 1. The equation involves multiplication of a mole fraction (a dimensionless quantity between 0 and 1) by a vapor pressure (typically measured in mm Hg or bar), yielding the partial vapor pressure of the component in the solution. This linear relationship assumes ideal behavior with no intermolecular interactions deviating from ideality. The context discusses deviations from Raoult's law, azeotropes, and colligative properties, highlighting the importance of this equation in understanding vapor-liquid equilibria, solution behavior, and phase separation. Physically, it quantifies how the presence of other components reduces the escaping tendency of molecules, thus lowering vapor pressure. The equation is foundational in thermodynamics and physical chemistry for predicting vapor pressures of mixtures, calculating compositions of vapor and liquid phases, and analyzing colligative properties such as vapor pressure lowering, boiling point elevation, and freezing point depression. It relates to other concepts like deviations from ideality (positive and negative deviations), azeotrope formation, and the calculation of molar masses from vapor pressure data. Practically, it is used in distillation, solvent selection, chemical engineering design, and understanding solution properties.

Mathematically, it expresses the fractional decrease in the vapour pressure of the solvent (p_1^0 - p_1) normalized by the pure solvent vapour pressure p_1^0, equating it to the mole fraction of the solute x_2. Here, p_1^0 is the vapour pressure of the pure solvent, p_1 is the vapour pressure of the solvent in solution, n_1 and n_2 are the number of moles of solvent and solute respectively, and x_2 = n_2 / (n_1 + n_2) is the mole fraction of the solute. The equation is derived from Raoult's law, which states that the partial vapour pressure of a solvent in an ideal solution is proportional to its mole fraction. The relative lowering of vapour pressure depends solely on the mole fraction of the solute, independent of its chemical nature, highlighting the colligative nature of this property. This relationship is crucial for determining molar masses of solutes by measuring vapour pressure changes, as demonstrated in the surrounding context. It also underpins other colligative phenomena such as boiling point elevation and freezing point depression.

The right-hand side relates this relative lowering to the ratio of the number of moles of solute to solvent, expressed via masses and molar masses: the numerator is the product of the solute mass (0.5 g) and solvent molar mass (78 g/mol), and the denominator is the product of the unknown solute molar mass (M_2) and solvent mass (39 g). Variables include p_1^0 (vapour pressure of pure solvent), p (vapour pressure of solution), w_2 and w_1 (masses of solute and solvent), M_1 and M_2 (molar masses of solvent and solute). The equation uses basic arithmetic operations and the concept of mole fraction approximation for dilute solutions. It is applied in physical chemistry to determine the molar mass of an unknown solute by measuring vapour pressure changes, leveraging Raoult's law and colligative property principles. The equation is significant as it connects macroscopic measurable quantities (vapour pressures, masses) to molecular-level information (molar mass), facilitating experimental determination of molecular weights. It relates to other colligative properties discussed in the context, such as boiling point elevation and freezing point depression, all dependent on solute particle concentration.

It depicts two vapor pressure curves plotted against temperature in Kelvin (K). The x-axis represents temperature ranging approximately from 360 K to 380 K, and the y-axis represents vapor pressure in bar, ranging from 0.8 to 1.05 bar. Two distinct curves are shown: one labeled 'Pure water' and the other labeled 'Solution.' The curve for pure water lies above the curve for the solution across the temperature range, indicating that the vapor pressure of the solution is consistently lower than that of pure water at the same temperature. A horizontal dashed line is drawn at 1.013 bar, representing atmospheric pressure. The boiling point of pure water, denoted as T_b^0, is marked where the pure water curve intersects the atmospheric pressure line, approximately at 373.15 K (100°C). The boiling point of the solution, denoted as T_b, is marked where the solution curve intersects the atmospheric pressure line, at a higher temperature than T_b^0. The difference between these two boiling points, ΔT_b = T_b - T_b^0, is indicated on the graph, illustrating the elevation of boiling point due to the presence of solute. The graph uses a clean, scientific style with clear labels and a legend. The color scheme uses blue for the pure water curve and red for the solution curve, enhancing visual distinction.

The equation is derived from colligative properties principles, emphasizing that boiling point elevation depends on solute particle quantity rather than chemical identity. It is fundamental in physical chemistry for determining molar masses of unknown solutes by measuring boiling point changes experimentally. The equation connects thermodynamic concepts of vapor pressure lowering and phase equilibrium, as the boiling point elevation arises due to decreased solvent vapor pressure in the presence of solute, requiring higher temperature to reach atmospheric pressure.

The numerator w_2 / M_2 converts the solute mass into moles, while the denominator w_1 / 1000 converts solvent mass from grams to kilograms, ensuring molality is expressed in moles per kilogram. This equation is fundamental in colligative properties, linking measurable quantities (masses) to molality, which directly influences properties like boiling point elevation and vapor pressure lowering. It is used to calculate molar masses of solutes experimentally by measuring boiling point elevation or vapor pressure changes.

It arises from the colligative property of boiling point elevation, which states that the increase in boiling point (ΔT_b) is proportional to the molality (m) of the solute. Here, the molality is expressed in terms of the mass of solute (w_2) and solvent (w_1), and the boiling point elevation constant (K_b) specific to the solvent. The formula rearranges the relation ΔT_b = K_b * m to solve for M_2, using the known quantities: K_b (2.53 K·kg·mol⁻¹ for benzene), w_2 (1.8 g solute), ΔT_b (0.88 K), and w_1 (90 g solvent). The factor 1000 g/kg converts solvent mass from grams to kilograms to maintain unit consistency. This equation is fundamental in physical chemistry for determining unknown molar masses via experimental boiling point elevation data. It connects thermodynamic properties (boiling point changes) with molecular characteristics (molar mass), illustrating the practical application of colligative properties in solution chemistry. The equation is part of a broader framework involving Raoult's law, vapor pressure lowering, and other colligative effects like freezing point depression, emphasizing the role of solute concentration on solvent properties.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-e682a8aff24a4aab88aebc4f20a4a563", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "\nImage Content Analysis:\nImage Path: /workspace/RAG-System-Chemistry/output/lech101/auto/images/fbf7364c69341521fb72413e9102da8163a4e955def168df0f157988080818e3.jpg\nCaptions: None\nFootnotes: None\n\nVisual Analysis: The image is a scientific diagram labeled as Fig. 1.8, illustrating the depression of the freezing point (ΔTf) of a solvent when a solute is dissolved in it. The diagram features two curves plotted on a graph with temperature on the x-axis and vapor pressure on the y-axis. The first curve represents the vapor pressure of the pure solvent, starting at a higher vapor pressure and decreasing as temperature lowers, intersecting a horizontal line at the freezing point of the pure solvent (Tf0). The second curve, representing the solution with a non-volatile solute, lies below the pure solvent curve, indicating a lower vapor pressure at each temperature. This curve intersects the horizontal line at a lower temperature, labeled Tf, showing the depressed freezing point. The vertical distance between Tf0 and Tf on the temperature axis is marked as ΔTf, highlighting the freezing point depression. The graph uses clear, contrasting lines with labels in black text on a white background, typical of textbook scientific illustrations. The diagram visually supports the surrounding text's explanation of how the addition of a non-volatile solute lowers the vapor pressure and consequently the freezing point of the solvent, demonstrating Raoult's law and the concept of freezing point depression.

Mathematically, it states that the freezing point depression \\( \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{f}} \\) is directly proportional to the molality \\( m \\) of the solute in the solution. Here, \\( \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{f}} = T_{\\mathrm{f}}^{0} - T_{\\mathrm{f}} \\) represents the decrease in freezing point, where \\( T_{\\mathrm{f}}^{0} \\) is the freezing point of the pure solvent and \\( T_{\\mathrm{f}} \\) is the freezing point of the solution. The proportionality constant \\( K_{\\mathrm{f}} \\), known as the freezing point depression constant or cryoscopic constant, depends on the solvent's intrinsic properties and has units of kelvin kilogram per mole (K kg mol^{-1}). The molality \\( m \\) is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent, \\( m = \\frac{n_{solute}}{mass_{solvent}} \\). This linear relationship arises from colligative properties, which depend solely on solute particle concentration, not their identity. The equation is derived under the assumption of ideal dilute solutions where solute-solvent interactions do not significantly deviate from ideality. Physically, the freezing point depression occurs because the solute lowers the solvent's vapor pressure, shifting the equilibrium between solid and liquid phases to a lower temperature. This equation is fundamental in physical chemistry and thermodynamics, linking phase equilibria with solution concentration. It is closely related to the boiling point elevation equation \\( \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{b}} = K_{\\mathrm{b}} m \\), where \\( K_{\\mathrm{b}} \\) is the ebullioscopic constant. Practically, this relation is used to determine molar masses of unknown solutes by measuring freezing point depression, and in applications such as antifreeze formulations and cryoscopy. Within the broader framework, it exemplifies how colligative properties provide insight into molecular characteristics and solution behavior, reinforcing the connection between macroscopic thermodynamic measurements and microscopic molecular quantities.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-89b9cea9e73322aa9545a5bb77a2fa2f", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'Chemistry ', 'bbox': [102, 901, 243, 915], 'page_idx': 17}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of the single word 'Chemistry' positioned on page 17, likely serving as a section or chapter heading.

Mathematically, both constants are expressed as functions of fundamental thermodynamic and physical properties of the solvent: the universal gas constant (R), the molar mass of the solvent (M_l), the square of the pure solvent's phase transition temperature (T_f for freezing, T_b for boiling), and the enthalpy changes associated with the phase transitions (Δ_fusH for fusion and Δ_vapH for vaporization). The division by 1000 is a unit conversion factor to maintain consistency in units. These constants quantify how much the freezing point lowers or the boiling point raises per molal concentration of a solute in an ideal dilute solution. The equations arise from thermodynamic principles relating vapor pressure changes and phase equilibria to colligative properties. They connect macroscopic measurable quantities (K_f, K_b) to molecular-level thermodynamic parameters, enabling calculation of colligative effects without direct experimental determination of K_f or K_b. This is crucial in physical chemistry and solution thermodynamics for determining molar masses of solutes, understanding solvent-solute interactions, and designing processes involving phase changes.

The first column lists nine solvents by name. The second column provides the boiling point in Kelvin and the molal boiling point elevation constant (Kb) in K kg mol-1, indicating how much the boiling point of the solvent increases per molal concentration of a solute. The third column shows the freezing point in Kelvin, and the fourth column lists the molal freezing point depression constant (Kf) in K kg mol-1, representing the decrease in freezing point per molal concentration of solute. Key data points include water with a boiling point of 373.15 K, Kb of 0.52, freezing point 273.0 K, and Kf of 1.86; benzene with boiling point 353.3 K, Kb 2.53, freezing point 278.6 K, and Kf 5.12; and carbon tetrachloride with boiling point 350.0 K, Kb 5.03, freezing point 250.5 K, and Kf 31.8. Patterns show that solvents with higher Kb values tend to have higher boiling point elevation effects, and those with higher Kf values exhibit greater freezing point depression effects. For example, carbon tetrachloride has the highest Kb (5.03) and Kf (31.8), indicating strong colligative property effects. The relationship between boiling point elevation and freezing point depression constants reflects the solvent's molecular interactions and thermodynamic properties. This table supports the surrounding content by providing empirical constants (Kb and Kf) necessary for calculating boiling point elevation and freezing point depression in solutions, as demonstrated in the examples on pages 17 and 19.

It relates the freezing point depression constant (K_f), the mass of the solute (w_2), the mass of the solvent (w_1), and the observed freezing point depression (ΔT_f). Specifically, the formula rearranges the freezing point depression relation ΔT_f = K_f * m (where m is molality) to solve for molar mass: M_2 = (K_f * w_2 * 1000) / (ΔT_f * w_1). Variables are defined as follows: K_f (cryoscopic constant) in K kg mol^-1, w_2 (solute mass in grams), w_1 (solvent mass in grams), and ΔT_f (freezing point depression in Kelvin). The multiplication by 1000 converts solvent mass from grams to kilograms to maintain unit consistency in molality. The equation uses division and multiplication operations and is grounded in thermodynamics and physical chemistry principles. It is applied in determining molar masses of solutes, especially non-electrolytes, by measuring freezing point depression. This method is significant for characterizing molecular weights of substances that do not ionize in solution.

The funnel is sealed with a semipermeable membrane at its narrow end, which is submerged in the solvent. The solvent level inside the thistle funnel is shown to rise compared to the solvent level outside in the container, visually demonstrating the osmotic flow of solvent molecules through the semipermeable membrane into the solution. The setup includes a vertical scale or markings on the thistle funnel to indicate the rising liquid level. The background is plain, focusing attention on the apparatus. The colors are realistic with the glass apparatus rendered in transparent or light blue tones, the solution inside the funnel depicted in a slightly darker shade to differentiate it from the pure solvent. The lighting is even and neutral, emphasizing clarity and scientific accuracy.

The composition is a schematic diagram showing two compartments separated by a vertical semipermeable membrane. The left compartment contains pure solvent, depicted as a clear liquid, while the right compartment contains a solution with solute particles dispersed in the solvent. The solute particles are represented as small colored spheres or dots suspended in the solution. Above the solution side, an arrow points downward indicating an applied pressure labeled as 'Excess Pressure = Osmotic Pressure'. This pressure is shown acting on the solution side to prevent the flow of solvent molecules from the pure solvent side to the solution side. The membrane is visually represented as a thin vertical barrier with small pores, emphasizing its selective permeability that allows only solvent molecules to pass through but blocks solute particles. The background is plain, focusing attention on the diagram elements. The colors used are simple and clear: the solvent is typically shown in a light blue or transparent shade, solute particles in a contrasting color such as red or orange, and the membrane in gray or black. The lighting is uniform with no shadows, consistent with a technical illustration style. The diagram effectively conveys the principle that osmotic pressure is the excess pressure required to stop osmosis, aligning with the surrounding text on page 19 that explains osmotic pressure as a colligative property dependent on solute concentration. This image supports the theoretical explanation by providing a clear visual representation of the physical setup and forces involved in osmosis and osmotic pressure measurement.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "eJwFwWtIVFkAAGCNchkWM80G8ZGNNTP3ce7byh5QtiixZYW9XHOzlxHWDln0oMSmwnXdEKxYNslGx3ncuXfOuefcO1OBJNNKlEYUQ1k00o9KyfqzZSURGX2fHU1iJ68y9bIQaZNtwjn51aJ7pic4fe0hc4oUFOxyMtGFJMQfLD0GC80k2mtdliT6Ar11YSXzgeTMcbgSxgkRauvAC1AQ7wWGXqvZ0C7B28UadvCTPgUXwC9kyBo3L2Xp0GQKyUczoJ4xlvJr6NGOu2BctHexws1rSfYIbIdZYBOb0kfBfaMBNLiW4v0Rn5TQmvH10hbsZSbDa0gum5/vwbTYbVXpbeCQfl7thI7setAaUeFrIUhOKCnyVJwoZvlF0r/gc19F6CJnRHYyv2hlIBXx8xR7GObGmkiPNOgbQWlpdiXTStIre16iW2Qi+AV1WDY5HSf1meaEMoBsKE8t507Sm5lv3C12KpwT3S044XPzKW6RM0p2clThNp/C1agZ4jxciZaJdrIkNosf86Woca4ddpLq/MeRGb1SuN0Z5t75ygLrYC/VTF+wRtyNvneRIv0A96u8QsqLJdhB0QwfiDd2v/HncX+h39BtabmwGZ3kO9255LJRgpviI7RXeFO0LbTHsoSP+nFyD7XANG95/sau1TjDlc79Ldhw5pXFrqagRI+Ja0P7gB4f/ScdtnGfwgljIE4UAL4zNY76viT4sy8t5gHz2Vr0vzpmHNT20wguMbOzN/Ff3bOJKLPk5+hbuYp2kP4rdeQqf8dZTqncDak/uBfFSuq4m8whMAy6tQc4iSfhFvcTphXMjZ7lssFL0cM3KJlGP1WGFsd6WAyrOZ05Kza6nqO1bpv/vctiKsBU8fVon/xMnOFtlVcxn1mTbCAJ6T9lD/WHfkasUYfFHn25KQiMDPAOf7X6DVb6VbMWLxO2yzZ2A9UdOIoeMZia5jKKTxs7jFIpy6xyrDduiB3wd7cdH9WfFNVK7wPTUquZI6a0IX2Ab+GrSAUMaR5eC0j+5gCtKK5o4AeY2FiR"}, {"__id__": "chunk-637d83a7d974cf4c03fab547947b17c0", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\n\\Pi = C R T\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: The equation \\( \\Pi = C R T \\) represents the osmotic pressure (\\( \\Pi \\)) of a dilute solution, where \\( C \\) is the molar concentration (molarity) of the solute, \\( R \\) is the universal gas constant, and \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.

The theoretical significance lies in explaining solvent flow across semipermeable membranes and the equilibrium condition where osmotic pressure balances solvent chemical potential differences. Practically, it underpins techniques in molecular weight determination, medical diagnostics (e.g., isotonic solutions), and understanding biological processes involving cell membranes. Within the broader framework, this equation exemplifies how thermodynamic principles govern solution behavior and membrane transport phenomena, linking microscopic molecular properties to macroscopic measurable quantities.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-1935c0075999947f488cc60f0820fc19", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'Solutions ', 'bbox': [762, 901, 895, 915], 'page_idx': 20}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of the single word 'Solutions' positioned on page 20, likely serving as a heading or section title.

Here, T represents the thermodynamic temperature at which the osmotic pressure measurement is conducted, and R is the proportionality constant linking pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of substance in ideal gas and solution contexts. The equation's role is to provide the numerical values necessary for calculating osmotic pressure or related quantities such as molar mass of solutes from experimental data.

The layout is horizontally oriented, showing two compartments separated by a semipermeable membrane. On the left side, labeled 'Sea Water' or 'Solution Side,' there is a depiction of seawater containing dissolved salts and impurities, represented by small colored dots or particles. On the right side, labeled 'Pure Water' or 'Solvent Side,' there is clear water with no impurities. Above the solution side, a mechanical press or piston is shown applying pressure, indicated by an arrow pointing downward, symbolizing the external pressure greater than the osmotic pressure. The semipermeable membrane is depicted as a thin vertical barrier that allows only water molecules to pass through while blocking salts and impurities. Arrows show the direction of water flow from the seawater side through the membrane to the pure water side, opposite to natural osmosis. The colors used are primarily blue tones for water, with darker shades representing seawater and lighter shades for pure water. The membrane is shown in a neutral color, such as gray or white, to distinguish it from the fluids.

Mathematically, it expresses the fractional decrease in vapor pressure (p_1^∘ - p_1) / p_1^∘ of the pure solvent (p_1^∘) upon addition of a solute, where p_1 is the vapor pressure of the solvent in solution. The variables n_2 and n_1 denote the number of moles of solute and solvent, respectively. The van't Hoff factor i quantifies the effective number of solute particles in solution after dissociation or association, modifying the ideal colligative property predictions. The equation is derived from Raoult's law and colligative property theory, extended to real solutions where solute particles may not remain intact. It is fundamental in physical chemistry for understanding how solutes affect solvent properties, especially in electrolyte solutions and molecular associations. This relation is crucial for calculating osmotic pressure, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, and vapor pressure lowering, all of which depend on the number of solute particles rather than their chemical identity. The equation links to the broader discussion on abnormal molar masses and the van't Hoff factor, providing a quantitative framework to interpret deviations from ideal solution behavior due to ionic dissociation or molecular association. Practical applications include water purification, desalination, and determining molecular weights of solutes via colligative properties in chemical and biochemical contexts.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-50e377eb06a79363970b67506f0a14c8", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'Chemistry ', 'bbox': [102, 901, 239, 915], 'page_idx': 23}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of the single word 'Chemistry' positioned on page 23, with no additional text or context.

The van't Hoff factor i quantifies the extent of dissociation of electrolytes in solution, with values approaching the theoretical maximum for complete dissociation as concentration decreases. The table is organized with salts listed in the first column, followed by three columns showing observed i values at decreasing concentrations, and a final column showing the theoretical i for complete dissociation. For NaCl and KCl, i values increase from approximately 1.85-1.87 at 0.1 m to 1.97-1.98 at 0.001 m, approaching the theoretical value of 2.00, indicating near-complete dissociation at low concentrations. For MgSO4, i values rise from 1.21 at 0.1 m to 1.82 at 0.001 m, approaching but not reaching the theoretical 2.00, suggesting partial dissociation. For K2SO4, i values increase from 2.32 at 0.1 m to 2.84 at 0.001 m, nearing the theoretical 3.00, consistent with its three ions per formula unit. The footnote clarifies that the tabulated i values represent incomplete dissociation. The data illustrate the concentration dependence of electrolyte dissociation, supporting the surrounding discussion on van't Hoff factor as a measure of association/dissociation in solutions. The table concretely demonstrates how i approaches theoretical values at infinite dilution, validating the concept that colligative properties must be corrected by i to account for ionization extent. This supports the examples and equations in the text explaining abnormal molar masses and colligative property deviations due to association or dissociation, such as the nearly 0.5 i for ethanoic acid dimers and ~2 for KCl. Overall, the table provides empirical evidence for the theoretical framework of van't Hoff factor and its role in interpreting colligative phenomena in electrolyte solutions.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-bb2b776ea419feb79b753cd9b28ae0b0", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\n\\Delta T _ { f } = 1 . 6 2 \\ : \\mathrm { K }\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: The equation \\( \\Delta T_f = 1.62 \\; \\mathrm{K} \\) represents the experimentally observed depression in the freezing point of a benzene solution containing benzoic acid.

The variables include \\( \\Delta T_f \\) (freezing point depression in Kelvin), and implicitly the molality \\( m \\), molal freezing point depression constant \\( K_f \\), and van't Hoff factor \\( i \\). The equation is used to calculate the abnormal molar mass and degree of association of benzoic acid by comparing observed and expected freezing point depressions. The mathematical operations involve direct measurement and substitution into colligative property relations modified by the van't Hoff factor to account for molecular association. This equation is significant in physical chemistry for understanding molecular interactions in solution, particularly hydrogen bonding and association phenomena in non-polar solvents. It relates to the broader framework of colligative properties, van't Hoff factor, and molecular association/dissociation equilibria, providing practical insights into solution behavior and molecular aggregation. The freezing point depression is a key measurable parameter that, when combined with theoretical models, allows quantification of association extent and abnormal molar masses, crucial for characterizing solute-solvent interactions.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-31d6d547fba776a996619906d62fc92f", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\nM _ { 2 } = { \\frac { 4 . 9 \\mathrm { \\ K \\ k g \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } } \\times 2 \\mathrm { \\ g } \\times 1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { \\ g } \\mathrm { k g ^ { - 1 } } } { 2 5 \\mathrm { \\ g } \\times 1 . 6 2 \\mathrm { \\ K } } } = 2 4 1 . 9 8 \\mathrm { \\ g \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } }\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: This equation calculates the experimental molar mass (M_2) of benzoic acid dissolved in benzene using the depression in freezing point, a colligative property. The formula is derived from the freezing point depression relation \\( \\Delta T_f = K_f \\times m \\), where \\( K_f \\) is the molal freezing point depression constant of the solvent, and \\( m \\) is the molality of the solute. Here, the molality is expressed in terms of mass of solute and solvent, and the freezing point depression is experimentally measured.

The factor 1000 converts grams of solvent to kilograms. The equation rearranges the freezing point depression formula to solve for molar mass, reflecting the abnormal molar mass due to association (dimerization) of benzoic acid molecules in benzene. This abnormal molar mass is significantly higher than the expected molar mass of benzoic acid (~122 g/mol), indicating dimer formation.

Mathematically, K_a is defined as the ratio of the product of the molar concentrations of the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and hydrogen ion (H^+) to the molar concentration of undissociated acetic acid (CH3COOH). Here, the variables [CH3COO^-], [H^+], and [CH3COOH] denote the equilibrium molar concentrations of the respective species. The equation uses multiplication and division operations to express this ratio. The numerical values substituted correspond to the molality of acetic acid (0.0106 mol/kg) and the degree of dissociation (x = 0.041), reflecting the fraction of acid molecules dissociated into ions. The denominator accounts for the remaining undissociated acid concentration, calculated as the initial molality times (1 - x). This expression arises from the equilibrium condition of a weak acid dissociation reaction, linking the experimentally determined van't Hoff factor and freezing point depression to the acid's dissociation constant. The equation is central in physical chemistry and solution chemistry, providing insight into acid strength, ionization equilibria, and colligative properties. It relates to other concepts such as molality, degree of dissociation, and van't Hoff factor discussed in the context. Practically, it enables calculation of K_a from freezing point depression data, facilitating understanding of electrolyte behavior in solutions. Within the broader framework, this equation exemplifies the quantitative analysis of weak electrolyte dissociation using colligative properties and equilibrium thermodynamics.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-6236988299105c9e70c58325eceb3087", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'Chemistry ', 'bbox': [100, 900, 243, 915], 'page_idx': 25}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of the single word 'Chemistry' positioned on page 25, with no additional text or context.

The first row lists mole fractions of acetone ranging from 0 to 72.1%, indicating the composition of the binary mixture. The second row shows the vapor pressure of acetone (Pacetone) in mm Hg, increasing from 0 mm Hg at 0% acetone to 521.1 mm Hg at 72.1% acetone, reflecting the rising partial pressure of acetone as its mole fraction increases. The third row provides the vapor pressure of chloroform (Pchloroform) in mm Hg, decreasing from 632.8 mm Hg at 0% acetone (pure chloroform) to 120.7 mm Hg at 72.1% acetone, showing the reduction in chloroform partial pressure as acetone concentration rises. The data illustrate the vapor-liquid equilibrium behavior of the acetone-chloroform system, supporting the surrounding content's discussion on ideal and non-ideal solutions and deviations from Raoult's law. The trends indicate a negative deviation from ideality, as the total vapor pressure (sum of partial pressures) is lower than expected for an ideal solution, consistent with strong intermolecular interactions between acetone and chloroform molecules. This table concretely supports the concept of solution behavior and vapor pressure changes with composition, as discussed in the exercises on page 28, particularly problem 1.37.", "full_doc_id": "doc-4b41a3c6b9466cce5ef3a3f3030ac33d", "file_path": "lech101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-a95a0a0856aa8b76cd7a909ee42d1247", "__created_at__": 1762852316, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'Chemistry ', 'bbox': [102, 901, 243, 915], 'page_idx': 29}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of the single word 'Chemistry' positioned on page 29, with no additional text or context.

The subject is of importance both for theoretical and practical considerations. A large number of metals, sodium hydroxide, chlorine, fluorine and many other chemicals are produced by electrochemical methods. Batteries and fuel cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy and are used on a large scale in various instruments and devices. The reactions carried out electrochemically can be energy efficient and less polluting. Therefore, study of electrochemistry is important for creating new technologies that are ecofriendly. The transmission of sensory signals through cells to brain and vice versa and communication between the cells are known to have electrochemical origin. Electrochemistry, is therefore, a very vast and interdisciplinary subject. In this Unit, we will cover only some of its important elementary aspects. \n\nWe had studied the construction and functioning of Daniell cell (Fig. 2.1). This cell converts the chemical energy liberated during the redox reaction \n\nElectron flow \n\nto electrical energy and has an electrical potential equal to $1 . 1 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ when concentration of $Z \\mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ and $\\mathrm { \\Delta C u ^ { 2 + } }$ ions is unity $( 1 ~ \\mathrm { m o l } ~ \\mathrm { d m } ^ { - 3 } ) ^ { * }$ Such a device is called a galvanic or a voltaic cell. \n\nIf an external opposite potential is applied in the galvanic cell [Fig. 2.2(a)] and increased slowly, we find that the reaction continues to take place till the opposing voltage reaches the value $1 . 1 \\mathrm { V }$ [Fig. 2.2(b)] when, the reaction stops altogether and no current flows through the cell. Any further increase in the external potential again starts the reaction but in the opposite direction [Fig. 2.2(c)]. It now functions as an electrolytic cell, a device for using electrical energy to carry non-spontaneous chemical reactions. Both types of cells are quite important and we shall study some of their salient features in the following pages. \n\nWhen $\\mathrm { E } _ { \\mathrm { e x t } } = 1 . 1 ~ \\mathrm { V }$ (i) No flow of electrons or current.   \n(ii No chemical reaction. \n\nWhen $\\mathrm { E } _ { \\mathrm { e x t } } < 1 . 1$ V (i) Electrons", "full_doc_id": "doc-eb898d9882005d7ff285ccffcb4cd210", "file_path": "lech102.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-c7a4068482d2b0c8789305439bff6f6f", "__created_at__": 1762855729, "content": "chemical reactions.

In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for running a motor or other electrical gadgets like heater, fan, geyser, etc. \n\nDaniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following redox reaction occurs. \n\nThis reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition gives the overall cell reaction: \n\nThese reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell. The reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the oxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions of the cell are also called half-cells or redox couples. The copper electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode, the oxidation half-cell. \n\nWe can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each halfcell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two half-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1. Sometimes, both the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we do not require a salt bridge. \n\nAt each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make it positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode have a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the electrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At equilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively or negatively charged with respect to the solution. A potential difference develops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called electrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved in a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard electrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other half-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a positive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a potential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the switch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of electron flow. \n\nThe potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic cell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell potential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive force (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and the cathode on the right while representing the galvanic cell.

The cell potential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive force (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and the cathode on the right while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal and electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the halfcell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the left hand side i.e., \n\nThis is illustrated by the following example: \n\nCell reaction: \n\nHalf-cell reactions: \n\nIt can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction (2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as: \n\nThe potential of individual half-cell cannot be measured. We can measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one electrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect to this. According to convention, a half-cell called standard hydrogen electrode (Fig.3.3) represented by $\\mathrm { P t ( \\bar { s } ) } \\mid \\mathrm { H _ { 2 } ( g ) } \\mid \\mathrm { H ^ { + } ( a q ) }$ , is assigned a zero potential at all temperatures corresponding to the reaction \n\nThe standard hydrogen electrode consists of a platinum electrode coated with platinum black. The electrode is dipped in an acidic solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled through it. The concentration of both the reduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is maintained at unity (Fig. 2.3). This implies that the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar and the concentration of hydrogen ion in the solution is one molar. \n\nAt 298 K the emf of the cell, standard hydrogen electrode Il second half-cell constructed by taking standard hydrogen electrode as anode (reference half-cell) and the other half-cell as cathode, gives the reduction potential of the other half-cell.

The reverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu (or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion) under the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not dissolve in HCl. In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by hydrogen ion. The negative value of the standard electrode potential in the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or zinc can reduce hydrogen ions). \n\nIn view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in Fig. 2.1 can be written as: \n\nLeft electrode: $\\mathrm { Z n } ( \\mathrm { s } )  \\mathrm { Z n } ^ { 2 + }$ (aq, $\\mathrm { ~ 1 ~ M ~ 1 ~ 2 ~ e ~ } ^ { - }$ \n\nRight electrode: ${ \\mathrm { C u } } ^ { 2 + }$ (aq, $1 \\ \\mathrm { M } ) + 2 \\ \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }  \\mathrm { C u ( s ) }$ \n\nThe overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions and we obtain the equation: \n\nSometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes. They do not participate in the reaction but provide their surface for oxidation or reduction reactions and for the conduction of electrons. For example, $\\mathrm { P t }$ is used in the following half-cells: \n\nHydrogen electrode: $\\mathrm { P t } ( \\mathrm { s } ) \\mid \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } ( \\mathrm { g } ) \\mid \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } ( \\mathrm { a q } )$ \n\nwith half-cell reaction: $\\mathrm { H ^ { + } ( a q ) + e ^ { - }  \\Omega ^ { \\downarrow } 2 \\ H _ { 2 } ( g ) }$ \n\nBromine electrode: $\\mathrm { P t ( s ) } | \\mathrm { B r } _ { 2 } ( \\mathrm { a q } ) | \\ \\mathrm { B r } ^ { - } ( \\mathrm { a q } )$ \n\nWith half-cell reaction: $\\mathrm { \\Omega ^ { 1 } / 2 \\ B r _ { 2 } ( a q ) + e ^ { - }  B r ^ { - } ( a q ) }$ \n\nThe standard electrode potentials are very important and we can extract a lot of useful information from them. The values of standard electrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are given in Table 2.1.

If the standard electrode potential of an electrode is greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to hydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative then hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species. It can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the highest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas $( \\mathrm { F _ { 2 } } )$ has the maximum tendency to get reduced to fluoride ions $( \\mathrm { F ^ { - } } )$ and therefore fluorine gas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest reducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating that lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is the most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be seen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2.1 the standard electrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising power of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of the species on the right hand side of the reaction.

It can be measured with the help of a wheatstone bridge with which you are familiar from your study of physics. The electrical resistance of any object is directly proportional to its length, l, and inversely proportional to its area of cross section, $A .$ That is, \n\nThe constant of proportionality, p (Greek, rho), is called resistivity (specific resistance). Its SI units are ohm metre $\\left( \\Omega \\mathrm { ~ m } \\right)$ and quite often its submultiple, ohm centimetre $\\left( \\Omega \\mathrm { c m } \\right)$ is also used. IUPAC recommends the use of the term resistivity over specific resistance and hence in the rest of the book we shall use the term resistivity. Physically, the resistivity for a substance is its resistance when it is one metre long and its area of cross section is one $\\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ .

It also depends on the temperature and pressure at which the measurements are made. Materials are classified into conductors, insulators and semiconductors depending on the magnitude of their conductivity. Metals and their alloys have very large conductivity and are known as conductors. Certain non-metals like carbon-black, graphite and some organic polymers\\* are also electronically conducting. Substances like glass, ceramics, etc., having very low conductivity are known as insulators. Substances like silicon, doped silicon and gallium arsenide having conductivity between conductors and insulators are called semiconductors and are important electronic materials. Certain materials called superconductors by definition have zero resistivity or infinite conductivity. Earlier, only metals and their alloys at very low temperatures (0 to 15 K) were known to behave as superconductors, but nowadays a number of ceramic materials and mixed oxides are also known to show superconductivity at temperatures as high as 150 K. \n\nElectrical conductance through metals is called metallic or electronic conductance and is due to the movement of electrons. The electronic conductance depends on \n\n(i) the nature and structure of the metal (ii) the number of valence electrons per atom (ii) temperature (it decreases with increase of temperature). \n\nAs the electrons enter at one end and go out through the other end, the composition of the metallic conductor remains unchanged. The mechanism of conductance through semiconductors is more complex. \n\nWe already know that even very pure water has small amounts of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions $( { \\sim } 1 0 ^ { - 7 } \\mathrm { M } )$ which lend it very low conductivity $( \\mathrm { { 3 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \\mathrm { { S m ^ { - 1 } } } } } )$ ). when electrolytes are dissolved in water, they furnish their own ions in the solution hence its conductivity also increases.

However, for measuring the resistance of an ionic solution we face two problems. Firstly, passing direct current (DC) changes the composition of the solution. Secondly, a solution cannot be connected to the bridge like a metallic wire or other solid conductor. The first difficulty is resolved by using an alternating current (AC) source of power. The second problem is solved by using a specially designed vessel called conductivity cell. It is available in several designs and two simple ones are shown in Fig. 2.4. \n\nBasically it consists of two platinum electrodes coated with platinum black (finely divided metallic $\\mathrm { P t }$ is deposited on the electrodes electrochemically). These have area of cross section equal to $\\cdot _ { A } ,$ and are separated by distance $\\mathbf { \\nabla } ^ { \\cdot } l ^ { \\prime }$ . Therefore, solution confined between these electrodes is a column of length $l$ and area of cross section $A$ .The resistance of such a column of solution is then given by the equation: \n\nThe quantity $l / A$ is called cell constant denoted by the symbol, $G ^ { * }$ . It depends on the distance between the electrodes and their area of cross-section and has the dimension of length-' and can be calculated if we know I and A. Measurement of $l$ and $A$ is not only inconvenient but also unreliable. The cell constant is usually determined by measuring the resistance of the cell containing a solution whose conductivity is already known. For this purpose, we generally use KCl solutions whose conductivity is known accurately at various concentrations (Table 2.3) and at different temperatures. The cell constant, $G ^ { * }$ , is then given by the equation: \n\nOnce the cell constant is determined, we can use it for measuring the resistance or conductivity of any solution. The set up for the measurement of the resistance is shown in Fig. 2.5. \n\nIt consists of two resistances $R _ { 3 }$ and $R _ { 4 }$ ,a variable resistance $R _ { 1 }$ and the conductivity cell having the unknown resistance $R _ { 2 }$ .The wheatstone bridge is fed by an oscillator $\\mathrm { o }$ (a source of a.c. power in the audio frequency range 550 to 5000 cycles per second). $\\mathrm { P }$ is a suitable detector (a headphone or other electronic device) and the bridge is balanced when no current passes through the detector.

Conductivity always decreases with decrease in concentration both, for weak and strong electrolytes. This can be explained by the fact that the number of ions per unit volume that carry the current in a solution decreases on dilution. The conductivity of a solution at any given concentration is the conductance of one unit volume of solution kept between two platinum electrodes with unit area of cross section and at a distance of unit length. This is clear from the equation: \n\n$G = \\frac { \\kappa A } { l } = \\kappa$ = k (both A and l are unity in their appropriate units in 1 or cm) \n\nMolar conductivity of a solution at a given concentration is the conductance of the volume $V$ of solution containing one mole of electrolyte kept between two electrodes with area of cross section $A$ and distance of unit length. Therefore, \n\nSince $l = 1$ and $A = V$ ( volume containing 1 mole of electrolyte) \n\nMolar conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. This is because the total volume, $V ,$ of solution containing one mole of electrolyte also increases. It has been found that decrease in $\\kappa$ on dilution of a solution is more than compensated by increase in its volume. Physically, it means that at a given concentration, $\\Lambda _ { m }$ can be defined as the conductance of the electrolytic solution kept between the electrodes of a conductivity cell at unit distance but having area of cross section large enough to accommodate sufficient volume of solution that contains one mole of the electrolyte. when concentration approaches zero, the molar conductivity is known as limiting molar conductivity and is represented by the symbol $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ .The variation in $\\varLambda _ { m }$ with concentration is different (Fig. 2.6) for strong and weak electrolytes. \n\nStrong Electrolytes \n\nFor strong electrolytes, $\\boldsymbol { { \\Lambda } } _ { m }$ increases slowly with dilution and can be represented by the equation: \n\nIt can be seen that if we plot (Fig. 2.6) $\\varLambda _ { m }$ against $c", "full_doc_id": "doc-eb898d9882005d7ff285ccffcb4cd210", "file_path": "lech102.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-f3b0ac78d0c935eea9a369b8d3388357", "__created_at__": 1762855729, "content": "\\circ }$ .The variation in $\\varLambda _ { m }$ with concentration is different (Fig. 2.6) for strong and weak electrolytes. \n\nStrong Electrolytes \n\nFor strong electrolytes, $\\boldsymbol { { \\Lambda } } _ { m }$ increases slowly with dilution and can be represented by the equation: \n\nIt can be seen that if we plot (Fig. 2.6) $\\varLambda _ { m }$ against $c ^ { 1 / 2 }$ obtain  stight  withintercept eq $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ equal to $\\cdot _ { - A } ,$ . The value of the constant $\\cdot _ { A } \\cdot \\mathbf { \\vec { \\tau } }$ for a given solvent and temperature depends on the type of electrolyte i.e., the charges on the cation and anion produced on the dissociation of the electrolyte in the solution. Thus, NaCl, $\\mathrm { C a C l } _ { 2 }$ , $\\mathrm { M g S O _ { 4 } }$ are known as 1-1, 2-1 and 2-2 electrolytes respectively.

Thus, $i f \\lambda _ { N a } ^ { ^ { \\circ } } { } ^ { + } a n d \\lambda _ { c l } ^ { ^ { \\circ } } { } ^ { - }$ ions respectively, then the limiting molar conductivity for sodium chloride is given by the equation: \n\nIn general, if an electrolyte on dissociation gives $\\ v { v } _ { + }$ cations and $\\mathrm { v _ { \\mathrm { - } } }$ anions then its limiting molar conductivity is given by: \n\nHere, $\\lambda _ { + } ^ { ^ { \\circ } }$ and $\\lambda _ { - } ^ { ^ { \\circ } }$ are the limiting molar conductivities of the cation and anion respectively. The values of $\\lambda ^ { ^ { \\circ } }$ for some cations and anions at 298 K are given in Table 2.4. \n\nWeak Electrolytes \n\nWeak electrolytes like acetic acid have lower degree of dissociation at higher concentrations and hence for such electrolytes, the change in $\\varLambda _ { m }$ with dilution is due to increase in the degree of dissociation and consequently the number of ions in total volume of solution that contains $1 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }$ of electrolyte. In such cases $\\varLambda _ { m }$ increases steeply (Fig. 2.6) on dilution, especially near lower concentrations. Therefore, $\\hat { { \\cal A } } _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ cannot be obtained by extrapolation of $\\varLambda _ { m }$ to zero concentration. At infinite dilution (i.e., concentration $c  z e r o ]$ electrolyte dissociates completely $\\scriptstyle ( \\alpha = 1 )$ , but at such low concentration the conductivity of the solution is so low that it cannot be measured accurately. Therefore, $\\hat { { \\cal A } } _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ for weak electrolytes is obtained by using Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions (Example 2.8). At any concentration $c$ if $\\alpha$ is the degree of dissociation then it can be approximated to the ratio of molar conductivity $\\varLambda _ { m }$ at the concentration c to limiting molar conductivity, $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { 0 }$ .

The electrochemical processes are of great importance in the laboratory and the chemical industry. One of the simplest electrolytic cell consists of two copper strips dipping in an aqueous solution of copper sulphate. If a DC voltage is applied to the two electrodes, then $\\mathrm { C u } ^ { \\bar { 2 } + }$ ions discharge at the cathode (negatively charged) and the follwing reaction takes place: \n\nCopper metal is deposited on the cathode. At the anode, copper is converted into $\\mathrm { { C u } ^ { 2 + } }$ ions by the reaction: \n\nThus copper is dissolved (oxidised) at anode and deposited (reduced) at cathode.

This is the basis for an industrial process in which impure copper is converted into copper of high purity. The impure copper is made an anode that dissolves on passing current and pure copper is deposited at the cathode. Many metals like Na, Mg, Al, etc. are produced on large scale by electrochemical reduction of their respective cations where no suitable chemical reducing agents are available for this purpose. \n\nSodium and magnesium metals are produced by the electrolysis of their fused chlorides and aluminium is produced by electrolysis of aluminium oxide in presence of cryolite. \n\nQuantitative Aspects of Electrolysis \n\nMichael Faraday was the first scientist who described the quantitative aspects of electrolysis. Now Faraday's laws also flow from what has been discussed earlier. \n\nFaraday's Laws of Electrolysis \n\nAfter his extensive investigations on electrolysis of solutions and melts of electrolytes, Faraday published his results during 1833-34 in the form of the following well known Faraday's two laws of electrolysis: \n\n(i) First Law: The amount of chemical reaction which occurs at any electrode during electrolysis by a current is proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte (solution or melt).   \n(ii) Second Law: The amounts of different substances liberated by the same quantity of electricity passing through the electrolytic solution are proportional to their chemical equivalent weights (Atomic Mass of Metal $\\div$ Number of electrons required to reduce the cation). \n\nThere were no constant current sources available during Faraday's times. The general practice was to put a coulometer (a standard electrolytic cell) for determining the quantity of electricity passed from the amount of metal (generally silver or copper) deposited or consumed. However, coulometers are now obsolete and we now have constant current $\\left( I \\right)$ sources available and the quantity of electricity $Q$ , passed is given by \n\n$Q$ is in coloumbs when $I$ is in ampere and $t$ is in second. \n\nThe amount of electricity (or charge) required for oxidation or reduction depends on the stoichiometry of the electrode reaction. For example, in the reaction: \n\nOne mole of the electron is required for the reduction of one mole of silver ions. ▲ \n\nWe know that charge on one electron is equal to $1 . 6 0 2 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 1 9 } \\mathrm { C }$ \n\nTherefore, the charge on one mole of electrons is equal to: \n\nThis quantity of electricity is called Faraday and is represented by the symbol $\\mathbf { F }$ \n\nFor approximate calculations we use $1 { \\mathrm { F } } \\simeq 9 6 5 0 0 { \\mathrm { ~ C ~ m o l } } ^ { - 1 } .$ \n\nFor the electrode reactions: \n\nIt is obvious that one mole of $\\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ and ${ \\mathbb { A } } ^ { 3 + }$ require $2 \\mathrm { m o l }$ of electrons (2F) and $3 \\mathrm { m o l }$ of electrons (3F) respectively. The charge passed through the electrolytic cell during electrolysis is equal to the product of current in amperes and time in seconds. In commercial production of metals, current as high as 5o,ooo amperes are used that amounts to about 0.518 $\\mathrm { F }$ per second. - \n\nExample 2.10 \n\nA solution of $\\mathrm { C u S O _ { 4 } }$ is electrolysed for 10 minutes with a current of 1.5 amperes", "full_doc_id": "doc-eb898d9882005d7ff285ccffcb4cd210", "file_path": "lech102.pdf", "vector": "eJwBAAP//OSrRyhmplQrKy7MrQIwP6QqKsQkZihPsMknzCU1r72qvyx4nyaw2Sw/Mfmvvi55sCIp8qsvp+qpwawZrMyipKgyIdQa76kZL6msa66EJCsxfS1LLSQuMqTnLXip4y2Ur4utmihCKVsk766drbQo9K3vpQMrPKhXLnqqIKj/KNqpEaZ0rasn27HarTYmxKCuqrat462AJMUm/C8yLZ4r564yKb+qIqDFstWjLp+NJw8oHaTHqasqRaVsr9GsGyyiKqcsIDDtqfylnyeBLU6sqq1HKkQk8iqCMMWuqSrjK76jc6d2LC0t2abDKOquXiv5Kmsj3o5WINsljKj6LNYwAABOK3EpXykhsNOpaKRCpVMtMy1bJU2tZTKDL0cqOhySpjQsga2LLAmxLyrlKGcomTCnLRys4ScLsManDqkmK58sb6PPGcCdeihILkQdWDHAqSOwjCsaJj8qxqgEJRyrpKPDLsop+6tvIWkwHCtvKdgw1KytJ6wt/izCpkAvT6cTKtawpS5SIU8p3SgKq7SfEK/uLZusLCl9LRQv16ZRH6au7KxJKL8rwK+HrECwPahuKueopy6lKr0m7CSerm6qAIAsLvqolqktpK6cd5+CqDwqpKkKqamvRSlyK8awxKoCsNiu7zADJKwrGp3jLDcYuq2WKloqg6pQsMshk6vDKkckoKDAKhCiQKZ2LHosLC62J8spg67EJ1kpWyhcLcGx+KtRrY2cZyBbp6CwlKxtq0WjFiparzaxwKU1HvStCjHtpO+rJyscqYcmTC9ArGIfvSwFqaaw7K5kIlgmrKdOJWqkWyu9MOYmGLFireWwVTIOMRurGyI9pT+sSY3tKGakAoCdI2oxIDFKrLYn0yoApiwouqD5ps0t/Ciqp3Sw6yweo8Ujh6RpJYwrUaaELuewqyj3LIQt+6XTqImx2ZaSqk+s+Z/lL2ajjbF1LAyu5qcuJyKvubCOKs8hXqs2pvaqUq2sJxArTqq4rzyuSafEqP8n6LDsqY0nQ6mHK98lUShALwYOYMs="}, {"__id__": "chunk-356b59e1599ba045af693f9fe30ba400", "__created_at__": 1762855729, "content": "the electrolytic cell during electrolysis is equal to the product of current in amperes and time in seconds.

If the electrode is inert (e.g., platinum or gold), it does not participate in the chemical reaction and acts only as source or sink for electrons. On the other hand, if the electrode is reactive, it participates in the electrode reaction. Thus, the products of electrolysis may be different for reactive and inert electrodes.The products of electrolysis depend on the different oxidising and reducing species present in the electrolytic cell and their standard electrode potentials. Moreover, some of the electrochemical processes although feasible, are so slow kinetically that at lower voltages these do not seem to take place and extra potential (called overpotential has to be applied, which makes such process more difficult to occur. \n\nFor example, if we use molten NaCl, the products of electrolysis are sodium metal and $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ gas. Here we have only one cation $\\boldsymbol { ( \\mathrm { N a ^ { + } ) } }$ which is reduced at the cathode $\\mathrm { ( N a ^ { + } + e ^ { - }  N a ) }$ and one anion (Cl) which is oxidised at the anode $\\mathrm { ( C l ^ { - }  ^ { 1 } 2 C l _ { 2 } + e ^ { - } }$ ). During the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride solution, the products are NaOH, $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ . In this case besides $\\mathrm { N a } ^ { + }$ and $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ ions we also have $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ and $\\mathrm { O H } ^ { - }$ ions along with the solvent molecules, $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ . \n\nAt the cathode there is", "full_doc_id": "doc-eb898d9882005d7ff285ccffcb4cd210", "file_path": "lech102.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-8f6611a4784fa607989c288cbcbff731", "__created_at__": 1762855729, "content": "2 }$ and $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ .

However, on account of overpotential of oxygen, reaction (2.36) is preferred. Thus, the net reactions may be summarised as: \n\n$\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\mathrm { N a C l ~ ( a q ) ~ } \\xrightarrow { \\mathrm { H _ 2 O } } \\mathrm { ~ N a ~ } ^ { + } \\mathrm { ( a q ) ~ } + \\mathrm { C l } ^ { - } \\mathrm { ~ ( a q ) } } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { C a t h o d e } \\mathrm { : } \\qquad \\mathrm { H _ 2 O } \\mathrm { ( \\it l ) } + \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }  \\mathrm { \\it / { 2 } } \\mathrm { ~ H _ 2 ( \\mathrm { g } ) ~ } + \\mathrm { O H } ^ { - } \\mathrm { ~ ( a q ) } } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { A n o d e } \\mathrm { : } \\qquad \\mathrm { C l } ^ { - } \\mathrm { ~ ( a q ) }  \\mathrm { \\it / { 2 } ~ C l _ 2 ( \\mathrm { g } ) ~ } + \\mathrm { ~ e } ^ { - } } \\end{array}$ Net reaction: $\\mathrm { { N a C l } ( a q ) + H _ { 2 } O ( \\mathit { l } ) \\to \\mathrm { N a } ^ { + } ( a q ) + O H ^ { - } ( a q ) + ^ { 1 } / 2 H _ { 2 } ( g ) + ^ { 1 } / 2 C l _ { 2 } ( g ) }$ \n\nThe standard electrode potentials are replaced by electrode potentials given by Nernst equation (Eq. 2.8) to take into account the concentration effects.

However, for a battery to be of practical use it should be reasonably light, compact and its voltage should not vary appreciably during its use. There are mainly two types of batteries. \n\n2.6.1 Primary Batteries \n\nCarbon rod (cathode) \n\nIn the primary batteries, the reaction occurs only once and after use   \nover a period of time battery becomes dead and cannot be reused again. The most familiar example of this type is the dry cell (known as Leclanche cell after its discoverer) which is used commonly in our transistors and clocks. The cell consists of a zinc container that also acts as anode and the cathode is a carbon (graphite) rod surrounded by powdered manganese dioxide and carbon (Fig.2.8). The space between the electrodes is filled by a moist paste of ammonium chloride $\\mathrm { ( N H } _ { 4 } \\mathrm { C l ) }$ and zinc chloride $\\mathrm { ( Z n C l _ { 2 } ) }$ .The electrode reactions are complex, but they can be written approximately as follows : \n\nAnode: $\\mathrm { Z n ( s ) \\longrightarrow Z n ^ { 2 + } + 2 e ^ { - } }$ \n\nCathode: $\\mathrm { M n O _ { 2 } ^ { + } \\Delta N H _ { 4 } ^ { + } { } ^ { + } \\ e ^ { - } \\longrightarrow M n O ( O H ) + N H _ { 3 } }$ \n\nIn the reaction at cathode, manganese is reduced from the $^ \\mathrm { ~ + ~ 4 ~ }$ oxidation state to the $+ 3$ state. Ammonia produced in the reaction forms a complex with $Z \\mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ to give $\\mathrm { [ Z n \\ ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 + } }$ .

A good secondary cell can undergo a large number of discharging and charging cycles. The most important secondary cell is the lead storage battery (Fig. 2.10) commonly used in automobiles and invertors. It consists of a lead anode and a grid of lead packed with lead dioxide $\\mathrm { ( P b O _ { 2 } }$ ) as cathode. A $3 8 \\%$ solution of sulphuric acid is used as an electrolyte. \n\nThe cell reactions when the battery is in use are given below: \n\nAnode: $\\mathrm { P b } ( \\mathrm { s } ) + \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } ^ { 2 - } ( \\mathrm { a q } )  \\mathrm { P b } \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } ( \\mathrm { s } ) + 2 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }$ \n\n.e., overall cell reaction consisting of cathode and anode reactions is: \n\nOn charging the battery the reaction is reversed and $\\mathrm { P b S O _ { 4 } ( s ) }$ on anode and cathode is converted into $\\mathrm { P b }$ and $\\mathrm { P b } { \\cal O } _ { 2 }$ , respectively. \n\nAnother important secondary cell is the nickel-cadmium cell (Fig. 2.1 1) which has longer life than the lead storage cell but more expensive to manufacture. We shall not go into details of working of the cell and the electrode reactions during charging and discharging. The overall reaction during discharge is: \n\n2.7 fuel Cells \n\nProduction of electricity by thermal plants is not a very efficient method and is a major source of pollution.

In such plants, the chemical energy (heat of combustion) of fossil fuels (coal, gas or oil) is first used for converting water into high pressure steam. This is then used to run a turbine to produce electricity. We know that a galvanic cell directly converts chemical energy into electricity and is highly efficient. It is now possible to make such cells in which reactants are fed continuously to the electrodes and products are removed continuously from the electrolyte compartment. Galvanic cells that are designed to convert the energy of combustion of fuels like hydrogen, methane, methanol, etc. directly into electrical energy are called fuel cells. \n\nOne of the most successful fuel cells uses the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to form water (Fig. 2.12). The cell was used for providing electrical power in the Apollo space programme. The water vapours produced during the reaction were condensed and added to the drinking water supply for the astronauts. In the cell, hydrogen and oxygen are bubbled through porous carbon electrodes into concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. Catalysts like finely divided platinum or palladium metal are incorporated into the electrodes for increasing the rate of electrode reactions. The electrode reactions are \n\ngiven below: \n\nOverall reaction being: $\\mathrm { 2 H _ { 2 } ( g ) + O _ { 2 } ( g ) \\longrightarrow 2 H _ { 2 } O ( l ) }$ \n\nThe cell runs continuously as long as the reactants are supplied. Fuel cells produce electricity with an efficiency of about $7 0 \\%$ compared to thermal plants whose efficiency is about $4 0 \\%$ . There has been tremendous progress in the development of new electrode materials, better catalysts and electrolytes for increasing the efficiency of fuel cells. These have been used in automobiles on an experimental basis.

It causes enormous damage to buildings, bridges, ships and to all objects made of metals especially that of iron. We lose crores of rupees every year on account of corrosion. \n\nIn corrosion, a metal is oxidised by loss of electrons to oxygen and formation of oxides. Corrosion of iron (commonly known as rusting) occurs in presence of water and air. The chemistry of corrosion is quite complex but it may be considered essentially as an electrochemical phenomenon. At a particular spot (Fig. 2.13) of an object made of iron, oxidation takes place and that spot behaves as anode and we can write the reaction \n\nElectrons released at anodic spot move through the metal and go to another spot on the metal and reduce oxygen in the presence of $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ (which is believed to be available from $\\mathrm { { H _ { 2 } C O _ { 3 } } }$ formed due to dissolution of carbon dioxide from air into water. Hydrogen ion in water may also be available due to dissolution of other acidic oxides from the atmosphere). This spot behaves as cathode with the reaction \n\nThe overall reaction being: \n\nThe ferrous ions are further oxidised by atmospheric oxygen to ferric ions which come out as rust in the form of hydrated ferric oxide $( \\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 } . \\ x \\ \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } )$ and with further production of hydrogen ions. \n\nPrevention of corrosion is of prime importance. It not only saves money but also helps in preventing accidents such as a bridge collapse or failure of a key component due to corrosion. One of the simplest methods of preventing corrosion is to prevent the surface of the metallic object to come in contact with atmosphere. This can be done by covering the surface with paint or by some chemicals (e.g. bisphenol). Another simple method is to cover the surface by other metals (Sn, Zn, etc.) that are inert or react to save the object. An electrochemical method is to provide a sacrificial electrode of another metal (like Mg, Zn, etc.) which corrodes itself but saves the object. \n\nIntext Questions \n\n2.13 Write the chemistry of recharging the lead storage battery, highlighting all the materials that are involved during recharging. \n\n2.14 Suggest two materials other than hydrogen that can be used as fuels in fuel cells. \n\n2.15 Explain how rusting of iron is envisaged as setting up of an electrochemical cell. \n\nThe Hydrogen Economy \n\nAt present the main source of energy that is driving our economy is fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. As more people on the planet aspire to improve their standard of living, their energy requirement will increase. In fact, the per capita consumption of energy used is a measure of development. Of course, it is assumed that energy is used for productive purpose and not merely wasted. We are already aware that carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil fuels is resulting in the 'Greenhouse Effect'. This is leading to a rise in the temperature of the Earth's surface, causing polar ice to melt and ocean levels to rise. This will flood low-lying areas along the coast and some island nations such as Maldives face total submergence. In order to avoid such a catastrope, we need to limit our use of carbonaceous fuels. Hydrogen provides an ideal alternative as its combustion results in water only. Hydrogen production must come from splitting water using solar energy. Therefore, hydrogen can be used as a renewable and non polluting source of energy. This is the vision of the Hydrogen Economy.

Both the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water and hydrogen combustion in a fuel cell will be important in the future. And both these technologies are based on electrochemical principles. \n\nSummary \n\nAn electrochemical cell consists of two metalic electrodes dipping in electrolytic solution(s). Thus an important component of the electrochemical cell is the ionic conductor or electrolyte. Electrochemical cells are of two types. In galvanic cell, the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical work, whereas in an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to carry out a nonspontaneous redox reaction. The standard electrode potential for any electrode dipping in an appropriate solution is defined with respect to standard electrode potential of hydrogen electrode taken as zero. The standard potential of the cell an $\\ : [ \\ : E _ { \\mathrm { ( c e l l ) } } ^ { \\mathrm { o } } \\ : = \\ : E ^ { \\mathrm { o } } \\ :$ catie $E ^ { 0 }$ related to standard Gibbs energy $( \\Delta _ { r } G ^ { \\mathrm { o } } ~ = ~ - n F E _ { \\mathrm { ( c e l l ) } } ^ { \\mathrm { o } } )$ and equilibrium constant $( \\Delta _ { r } G ^ { \\mathrm { o } } = - \\ R T \\ln \\ K )$ of the reaction taking place in the cell. Concentration dependence of the potentials of the electrodes and the cells are given by Nernst equation. \n\nThe conductivity, $\\kappa ,$ of an electrolytic solution depends on the concentration of the electrolyte, nature of solvent and temperature. Molar conductivity, $\\varLambda _ { m }$ ,is defined by $\\quad = \\ \\kappa / c$ where $c$ is the concentration. Conductivity decreases but molar conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. It increases slowly with decrease in concentration for strong electrolytes while the increase is very steep for weak electrolytes in very dilute solutions. Kohlrausch found that molar conductivity at infinite dilution, for an electrolyte is sum of the contribution of the molar conductivity of the ions in which it dissociates. It is known as law of independent migration of ions and has many applications. Ions conduct electricity through the solution but oxidation and reduction of the ions take place at the electrodes in an electrochemical cell. Batteries and fuel cells are very useful forms of galvanic cell. Corrosion of metals is essentially an electrochemical phenomenon. Electrochemical principles are relevant to the Hydrogen Economy. \n\n2.1 Arrange the following metals in the order in which they displace each other from the solution of their salts.

The layout is horizontally oriented, showing two separate half-cells connected by a salt bridge. On the left side, there is a zinc electrode immersed in a solution containing Zn2+ ions, represented by a beaker labeled with Zn2+ ions and a Zn metal rod. On the right side, a copper electrode is immersed in a Cu2+ ion solution, similarly depicted with a beaker and a Cu metal rod. The salt bridge, typically a U-shaped tube filled with an electrolyte, connects the two solutions, allowing ion flow to maintain electrical neutrality. Arrows indicate the flow of electrons from the zinc electrode (anode) through an external wire to the copper electrode (cathode), demonstrating the direction of electron movement. The zinc electrode is labeled as the anode where oxidation occurs (Zn dissolves into Zn2+ ions), and the copper electrode is labeled as the cathode where reduction occurs (Cu2+ ions gain electrons and deposit as copper metal). The diagram includes voltage notation showing the cell potential of approximately 1.1 V under standard conditions (1 mol dm^-3 ion concentration). The background is plain white, and the colors used are realistic: metallic gray for electrodes, blue for the Zn2+ solution, and reddish-brown for the Cu2+ solution, enhancing clarity. The image uses clear, legible labels and arrows to explain the electrochemical processes, consistent with the surrounding text that discusses the Daniell cell's construction, function, and the flow of electrons and ions. This visual aids in understanding the conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy and the fundamental operation of galvanic cells, directly supporting the unit's objectives on electrochemical cells and their potentials.", "full_doc_id": "doc-eb898d9882005d7ff285ccffcb4cd210", "file_path": "lech102.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-e3dcde556ecc6131055edccab0d04492", "__created_at__": 1762857906, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'Reprint 2025-26 ', 'bbox': [447, 973, 550, 984], 'page_idx': 0}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of a brief text snippet 'Reprint 2025-26' located at the bottom of the page, likely serving as a publication or printing date reference.

Mathematically, it is a balanced chemical equation describing the transfer of electrons between zinc and copper species. Here, Zn(s) is solid zinc metal, Cu^{2+}(aq) is the aqueous copper ion, Zn^{2+}(aq) is the aqueous zinc ion, and Cu(s) is solid copper metal. The reaction involves oxidation of zinc metal to zinc ions (Zn → Zn^{2+} + 2e^-) and reduction of copper ions to copper metal (Cu^{2+} + 2e^- → Cu). The equation encapsulates the electron transfer process that generates an electromotive force (emf) in the galvanic cell. The mathematical operations implicit include stoichiometric balancing and electron conservation. This reaction is fundamental in electrochemistry, illustrating the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy. It relates directly to concepts such as electrode potentials, standard reduction potentials, Gibbs free energy change, and the Nernst equation, which quantify the cell's voltage and spontaneity. Practically, this reaction underpins the operation of batteries and electrochemical cells used in energy storage and conversion technologies. Within the broader framework, this equation exemplifies the principles of redox chemistry and electrochemical energy conversion discussed in the unit, serving as a foundational example for understanding galvanic and electrolytic cells, electrode potentials, and related thermodynamic relationships.", "full_doc_id": "doc-eb898d9882005d7ff285ccffcb4cd210", "file_path": "lech102.pdf", "vector": "eJwFwX1MVVUAAHDUMCF4fsw0ETV5D+7XOeeec59ry+d0uEnL8qNlKzemgjpXBnM6U2YhPkj/QIHnpqIzlPfufdxz7zn3nnsfOgUV0Q1Xf5RLy2qNNUzmxLZUFrXa6Pcb7k3gX/koWqk9UTqgp9zWrLlfsrxwiERoV67BZ0o9KRLbpCSsdV/VJth+OEbPigPQ9uvoa3zS/DB2A5xx7xsJ/2V5yA/KA6so/iah1l94sWzgao7EbfZEa9feD2rxBjDNqPMOX8gsmGUlSg17nXPCqQd7xChqdqvcef4KWsfvBMNh0j5F5sdfuD++HoEJVYDhmNWzRf9P2q3NYEfdGncN2ER0q0H9A+wAa6Nf47ulNHYu7sTLkBoe0eazEb0dP+h5Bb2hRtMFvEYeKx/BU6yP+Tts0m6syAInrKIlmaka0PLySJh2tpBm9aPj9Wg365xNwNXYPVYcX42fapVBiZC+6sp9QhoXnZQapM18LXxJb/OOs06xNZjpF17s1/PZ96xEPWQvARPoubFXjISFmimgsV1pyw7w+7HHZR9ouewObxy3yIPU1k87bfDP2FvoU2kWXsr/LT+IflFS4U9Ovr/R2ccqxAx9hRiAF2RXnOeMvC1awkXwkpLwrvsLLs/lBVpKOcMlrPjFjix2KXlN7ypF8PNeN92upXkUrPcGwEL+c/qF04oW8yFbdNfnysgSbqLnNEn67HXdHUqHY4Od/hwkq4foe2y254BRPkb78O+S0VMNbsYnRZ/5rXoNV5Fn4pHZ5GQzf+vFsOx8Z6YS/GMek2pFKfumu7l1wmssqGHbwhTtO+XjL1BhOFO+ZUzgxhwUQe8mfTm/BLaLfHiSJPEPYtA84F9WUuCh/112hInwMJsTh2Jq0wnVwqpRGZy9GAWDsJ/Wde8DWVID54GuIF9rMgJ1o7xLpgo2z9FI7379KErRhxnhEtrhJJ0IbcfV6nTlumhFDaIFad6x3APOOw+a4/bd6K3sZxYhvy27ykZZhGXpKukZEN643N+zjF1BOjwCllb8D0ZlWyQ="}, {"__id__": "chunk-735c8ad9558021c1258de87a5d0afe86", "__created_at__": 1762857906, "content": "\nImage Content Analysis:\nImage Path: /workspace/RAG-System-Chemistry/output/lech102/auto/images/0e30f8342289a99baaf2f670cad6fa3a9cacf0cc722e3b9b4b47eba52e82b547.jpg\nCaptions: None\nFootnotes: None\n\nVisual Analysis: The image depicts a detailed schematic diagram of a Daniell cell, an electrochemical cell used to convert chemical energy into electrical energy.

The layout consists of three distinct panels arranged horizontally, each depicting a different state of the electrochemical cell. Each panel shows a Daniell cell setup with two electrodes: a zinc (Zn) electrode on the left and a copper (Cu) electrode on the right, both immersed in their respective ionic solutions. The electrodes are connected externally by a wire, and a voltmeter is shown measuring the cell potential. The first panel (Fig. 2.2(a)) shows the Daniell cell operating spontaneously with electron flow from the zinc electrode (anode) to the copper electrode (cathode), generating an electrical current. The second panel (Fig. 2.2(b)) depicts the condition when the external voltage opposing the cell potential is increased to exactly 1.1 V, the standard emf of the Daniell cell. At this point, the reaction ceases, no electron flow occurs, and the voltmeter reads zero current. The third panel (Fig. 2.2(c)) illustrates the scenario where the external voltage exceeds 1.1 V, reversing the direction of electron flow and causing the cell to function as an electrolytic cell. Here, the non-spontaneous reaction is driven by the external power source, reversing the redox processes at the electrodes. The color scheme uses metallic gray for electrodes, blue for the copper sulfate solution, and a lighter blue or transparent color for the zinc sulfate solution, emphasizing the different electrolytes. Arrows indicate the direction of electron flow and current in each panel, with labels clarifying the processes occurring at the anode and cathode. The visual style is schematic and educational, with clear, labeled components and simplified representations to aid understanding.

Mathematically, it is a balanced chemical equation showing the transformation of reactants to products. Here, Zn(s) denotes solid zinc metal, Cu^{2+}(aq) is the aqueous copper ion with a +2 charge, Zn^{2+}(aq) is the aqueous zinc ion with a +2 charge, and Cu(s) is solid copper metal. The equation describes the oxidation of zinc metal to zinc ions and the simultaneous reduction of copper ions to copper metal. The reaction involves electron transfer: zinc loses two electrons (oxidation) and copper ions gain two electrons (reduction). This redox process generates an electromotive force (emf) that drives electron flow through an external circuit, converting chemical energy into electrical energy. The equation is fundamental in electrochemistry, illustrating the principle of galvanic cells, electrode potentials, and the relationship between chemical reactions and electrical work.

Here, $E_{\\mathrm{cell}}$ represents the overall cell potential measured in volts (V), $E_{\\mathrm{right}}$ is the standard electrode potential of the cathode where reduction occurs, and $E_{\\mathrm{left}}$ is the standard electrode potential of the anode where oxidation occurs. The subtraction operation reflects the potential difference driving electron flow from anode to cathode. This equation is fundamental in electrochemistry, linking thermodynamic spontaneity of redox reactions to measurable electrical energy output. It relies on the convention that the anode is placed on the left and the cathode on the right in cell notation. The electrode potentials are standard reduction potentials measured under standard conditions (1 M concentration, 1 bar pressure, 298 K). Physically, this potential difference corresponds to the Gibbs free energy change of the redox reaction, enabling conversion of chemical energy into electrical work. The equation is central to understanding galvanic cells like the Daniell cell, standard hydrogen electrode referencing, and the calculation of cell emf for various electrochemical systems.

The composition is centered around a vertical cylindrical container filled with an acidic aqueous solution, indicated by a light blue color representing the electrolyte containing hydrogen ions (H+). A platinum electrode, shown as a solid black vertical rod, is immersed in the solution. The platinum electrode is coated with a textured layer labeled 'platinum black,' which increases the surface area for the redox reaction. At the top of the container, pure hydrogen gas (H2) is bubbled through a tube connected to the solution, represented by small bubbles rising from the electrode surface. The gas is maintained at a pressure of 1 bar, as indicated by a label near the gas inlet. The concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution is maintained at 1 molar, consistent with standard conditions. The diagram includes labels for each component: 'Pt electrode,' 'H2 gas (1 bar),' 'H+ (1 M),' and 'acidic solution.' The container is shown with a boundary line, and the interface between the platinum electrode and the electrolyte is clearly marked, emphasizing the electrode-electrolyte interface where the redox reaction occurs. The visual style is technical and schematic, using clear lines and color coding to distinguish elements. The lighting is uniform, typical of scientific diagrams, with no shadows or three-dimensional effects. The image relates directly to the surrounding text, which explains the function and construction of the Standard Hydrogen Electrode as a reference half-cell with zero electrode potential, used to measure the electrode potentials of other half-cells. The diagram visually supports the explanation of the SHE's components and operating conditions, such as the use of platinum black to facilitate electron transfer and the maintenance of standard hydrogen ion concentration and gas pressure.

Here, $E^{\\mathrm{o}}$ denotes the overall standard cell potential, $E_{\\mathrm{R}}^{\\mathrm{o}}$ is the standard reduction potential of the cathode half-cell, and $E_{\\mathrm{L}}^{\\mathrm{o}}$ is the standard reduction potential of the anode half-cell. The equation involves subtraction of scalar quantities measured in volts (V), reflecting the potential difference driving electron flow in the electrochemical cell. This formulation is grounded in electrochemical conventions where the anode is placed on the left and the cathode on the right in cell notation. The standard electrode potentials are measured under standard conditions (1 M concentration, 1 bar pressure, 25°C) relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), which is assigned zero potential. The equation encapsulates the fundamental principle that the cell emf arises from the difference in the tendency of two half-reactions to gain electrons (reduction). It is central to understanding redox reactions, predicting spontaneity, and calculating thermodynamic properties such as Gibbs free energy change. This relationship is foundational in electrochemistry, linking half-cell potentials to the overall cell voltage, and is instrumental in applications including corrosion analysis, battery design, and electrochemical synthesis.

The logarithmic term accounts for the deviation from standard conditions by incorporating the ratio of the activities (or concentrations) of the reduced and oxidized species. The equation assumes the activity of the solid metal M is unity since it is a pure solid phase. This equation is fundamental in electrochemistry for calculating the electrode potential at any given concentration, thus extending the concept of standard electrode potentials to real-world conditions.

The reactions include various elements and compounds such as F2, Cl2, MnO4-, O2, Ag+, Fe3+, Cu2+, H+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, and Li+, among others. The electrode potentials range from a high of +2.87 V for fluorine gas reduction to a low of -3.05 V for lithium ion reduction. Key patterns include a general decrease in electrode potential from top to bottom, indicating a decrease in oxidizing power of the species on the left and an increase in reducing power of the species on the right. Fluorine (F2) has the highest positive electrode potential, confirming it as the strongest oxidizing agent, while lithium ion has the lowest, making lithium metal the strongest reducing agent.

Mathematically, it expresses the cell potential E_cell as a function of the standard cell potential E_cell^o and the ionic concentrations of Zn^{2+} and Cu^{2+} in solution. The variables are: E_cell (the actual cell potential under non-standard conditions), E_cell^o (the standard cell potential at 298 K), [Zn^{2+}] (the molar concentration of zinc ions), and [Cu^{2+}] (the molar concentration of copper ions). The constant 0.059 arises from the term (RT/nF) converted to base-10 logarithm at 298 K, where R is the gas constant, T the temperature, F the Faraday constant, and n=2 the number of electrons transferred per reaction. The logarithmic term log([Zn^{2+}]/[Cu^{2+}]) reflects the reaction quotient Q, indicating how deviations from standard concentrations affect the cell potential. The division by 2 corresponds to the two electrons involved in the redox reaction. This equation quantifies how the electrochemical potential varies with ion concentration, linking thermodynamics and electrochemistry.

Mathematically, it describes the transfer of electrons from solid zinc (Zn) to copper ions (Cu^{2+}) in aqueous solution, resulting in zinc ions (Zn^{2+}) in solution and solid copper (Cu). Here, Zn(s) and Cu(s) are the solid metal electrodes, while Cu^{2+}(aq) and Zn^{2+}(aq) are the aqueous ionic species. The reaction involves oxidation of zinc (loss of electrons) and reduction of copper ions (gain of electrons). This reaction is fundamental in electrochemistry, illustrating the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy. It is directly related to the Nernst equation, which quantifies the cell potential as a function of ion concentrations and temperature. The equation's physical significance lies in its role in determining the electromotive force (emf) of the cell, which depends on the standard electrode potentials and the reaction quotient.

This constant is mathematically related to the standard Gibbs free energy change $\\Delta_r G^\\circ$ and the standard cell potential $E_{\\mathrm{(cell)}}^\\circ$ through the thermodynamic relation $\\Delta_r G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K_C$ and the electrochemical relation $\\Delta_r G^\\circ = -nFE_{\\mathrm{(cell)}}^\\circ$, where $n$ is the number of moles of electrons transferred, $F$ is Faraday's constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin. The equation encapsulates the connection between electrochemical measurements and chemical thermodynamics, allowing determination of equilibrium constants from measurable cell potentials. This is crucial in electrochemistry for predicting reaction spontaneity, calculating cell voltages under non-standard conditions, and designing galvanic cells. The large magnitude of $K_C$ reflects the high driving force of the redox reaction in the cell, consistent with the standard electrode potentials provided in the surrounding context. This equation thus bridges the concepts of electrochemical cell potentials, Gibbs free energy, and chemical equilibrium, forming a foundational element in the quantitative analysis of electrochemical systems.", "full_doc_id": "doc-eb898d9882005d7ff285ccffcb4cd210", "file_path": "lech102.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-0cb8a82a516b0f777887e53f3b905939", "__created_at__": 1762857906, "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\n\\Delta _ { r } G = - \\ n F E _ { \\mathrm { ( c e l l ) } }\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: The equation \\( \\Delta_{r} G = - n F E_{\\mathrm{(cell)}} \\) expresses the fundamental thermodynamic relationship between the Gibbs free energy change of a redox reaction and the electromotive force (emf) of the electrochemical cell in which the reaction occurs.

Mathematically, resistance R is directly proportional to the length l of the conductor and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area A. The proportionality constant p (rho) is the resistivity, an intrinsic material property that quantifies how strongly the material opposes electric current. Formally, R = p * (l / A). Here, R is measured in ohms (Ω), l in meters (m), A in square meters (m²), and p in ohm-meters (Ω·m). This linear relationship arises from the microscopic scattering of charge carriers within the material. The equation is foundational in electrical conduction theory, linking macroscopic measurable quantities (R, l, A) to microscopic material characteristics (p). It underpins the design and analysis of electrical circuits and components, enabling calculation of resistance from physical dimensions and material type. In the broader context of the text, which discusses electrochemical cells, Gibbs energy, and conductivity, this equation provides the basis for understanding how electrical resistance affects current flow and energy dissipation in electrolytic and metallic conductors. It also relates to the inverse concepts of conductance (G = 1/R) and conductivity (kappa = 1/p), which are critical for characterizing materials as conductors, insulators, or semiconductors.

Mathematically, conductance G is defined as the reciprocal of resistance R, i.e., G = 1/R. Resistance R depends on the intrinsic property resistivity \\rho and the sample geometry, given by R = \\rho l / A. Substituting this into the conductance definition yields G = A / (\\rho l). Since conductivity \\kappa is the reciprocal of resistivity (\\kappa = 1/\\rho), the equation can also be written as G = \\kappa A / l. Here, G (siemens, S) quantifies how easily electric current flows through the material, R (ohms, \\Omega) measures opposition to current, \\rho (ohm meters, \\Omega m) characterizes the material's inherent resistance, \\kappa (siemens per meter, S/m) characterizes its ability to conduct, A (m^2) is the cross-sectional area perpendicular to current flow, and l (m) is the length along which current flows.

It is foundational in solid-state physics, materials science, and electrical engineering, underpinning the design and analysis of conductors, insulators, and semiconductors.

Key patterns include the vast difference in conductivity between metals and aqueous ionic solutions, and the extremely low conductivity of insulators. The data illustrates the concept from the surrounding text that conductivity depends on material type, temperature, and concentration for solutions. It supports the classification of materials into conductors, insulators, and semiconductors based on conductivity magnitude, and highlights the ionic conductance in electrolytic solutions compared to electronic conductance in metals.

The layout is a side-by-side comparison of two schematic diagrams, each illustrating a conductivity cell with labeled components. Both cells consist of a container holding an ionic solution, with two platinum electrodes immersed in the solution. The electrodes are coated with platinum black, depicted as textured or shaded areas on the electrode surfaces to indicate the finely divided metallic platinum coating. The electrodes are positioned parallel to each other, separated by a defined distance, representing the length 'l' of the solution column between them. The cross-sectional area 'A' of the electrodes is implied by their shape and size in the diagrams. The first cell design shows a simple cylindrical vessel with two flat electrodes facing each other inside the solution. The second design appears more complex, possibly with a different electrode arrangement or vessel shape, but still maintains the fundamental principle of two electrodes immersed in the solution. The diagrams use clean, technical line art with black lines on a white background, emphasizing clarity and precision typical of scientific illustrations. There are no colors beyond black and white, and the lighting is uniform, as the image is a schematic rather than a photograph.

Here, R denotes the resistance measured in ohms (\\Omega), l is the length of the conductive path (distance between electrodes) in meters, and A is the cross-sectional area perpendicular to current flow in square meters. The parameter \\rho represents the resistivity of the material, a fundamental physical property quantifying how strongly the material opposes electric current, measured in ohm-meters (\\Omega\\cdot m). The conductivity \\kappa is the reciprocal of resistivity (\\kappa = 1/\\rho), measured in siemens per meter (S/m), indicating the material's ability to conduct electric current. The equation shows that resistance is directly proportional to the length and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area and conductivity. This relationship is foundational in characterizing electrical conduction in materials, linking macroscopic measurable quantities (R, l, A) to intrinsic material properties (\\rho, \\kappa). In the context of ionic solutions and conductivity cells, this equation models the resistance of the solution column confined between electrodes, enabling determination of conductivity from measured resistance and known cell geometry. The cell constant G* = l/A encapsulates the geometric factors, facilitating practical conductivity measurements. This equation is central to electrochemistry, materials science, and electrical engineering, underpinning the classification of materials as conductors, semiconductors, or insulators based on their conductivity. It also relates to the use of Wheatstone bridges and AC measurement techniques to accurately determine solution resistances without altering solution composition.

Concentration is given in mol L^-1 and mol m^-3, conductivity is presented in S cm^-1 and S m^-1, and molar conductivity is shown in S cm^2 mol^-1 and S m^2 mol^-1. The data points include concentrations of 1.000 and 0.100 mol L^-1 (1000 and 100 mol m^-3), with corresponding conductivities of 0.1113 and 0.0129 S cm^-1 (11.13 and 1.29 S m^-1), and molar conductivities of 111.3 and 129.0 S cm^2 mol^-1 (111.3×10^-4 and 129.0×10^-4 S m^2 mol^-1). The table reveals that as concentration decreases from 1.000 to 0.100 mol L^-1, conductivity decreases significantly, but molar conductivity increases, indicating that ions move more freely at lower concentrations due to reduced ion-ion interactions. This trend aligns with the surrounding context explaining that conductivity depends on ion concentration, size, and mobility. The table supports the concept that molar conductivity is a more physically meaningful measure than conductivity alone, as it normalizes conductivity by concentration, reflecting ion mobility and dissociation efficiency.

The layout is a classic Wheatstone bridge configuration with four resistors arranged in a diamond shape. The top left resistor is labeled R1 and is a variable resistor, the top right resistor is labeled R2 and represents the conductivity cell containing the unknown electrolyte solution, the bottom left resistor is labeled R3, and the bottom right resistor is labeled R4. An oscillator labeled 'o' provides an alternating current (AC) source connected across the bridge. A detector labeled 'P' (which could be a headphone or electronic device) is connected between the two opposite junctions of the bridge to detect current flow. The bridge is balanced when no current passes through the detector, allowing calculation of the unknown resistance R2 using the formula R2 = (R1 * R4) / R3. The diagram uses simple black lines on a white background with clear labels for each component. The conductivity cell (R2) is visually distinguished as a rectangular box, indicating it contains the electrolyte solution. The oscillator and detector are represented by standard electrical symbols.

Specifically, it states that 1 S·m²·mol⁻¹ (siemens meter squared per mole) is equivalent to 10⁴ S·cm²·mol⁻¹ (siemens centimeter squared per mole), and conversely, 1 S·cm²·mol⁻¹ equals 10⁻⁴ S·m²·mol⁻¹. Here, S denotes siemens, the unit of conductance; m and cm represent meters and centimeters respectively, and mol⁻¹ indicates per mole, reflecting molar quantities. The equation involves scalar multiplication and dimensional analysis to convert between units differing by a factor of 10⁴ due to the squared length unit conversion (1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m² = 10⁴ cm²). This conversion is crucial in electrochemistry for expressing molar conductivity, which quantifies the conductance of an electrolyte solution normalized by concentration and electrode geometry.

Mathematically, the cell constant G* (with units of m^-1) divided by the resistance R (ohms) yields the conductivity κ (S m^-1) of the solution, expressed as κ = G*/R. Here, G* is a known constant determined from a standard solution, and R is the measured resistance of the unknown solution. The concentration c is converted from mol L^-1 to mol m^-3 by multiplying by 1000, reflecting unit consistency in SI. The molar conductivity Λ_m (S m^2 mol^-1) is then calculated by dividing the conductivity κ by the concentration c, Λ_m = κ/c. The equation shows numerical substitution: G*/R = 1299/5 = 0.248 S m^-1, concentration c = 0.02 mol L^-1 × 1000 = 20 mol m^-3, and molar conductivity Λ_m = 0.248 / 20 = 1.24 × 10^-4 S m^2 mol^-1. The operations include division and unit conversion, emphasizing dimensional analysis. This equation is central in electrochemistry for characterizing ionic solutions, linking electrical measurements to chemical concentration and mobility. It relates to the broader framework of conductivity measurement using a conductivity cell and the Wheatstone bridge method, providing a practical approach to determine solution properties without direct geometric measurement of the cell. The physical significance lies in quantifying how well ions conduct electricity, which depends on ion concentration, charge, and mobility.

Mathematically, the area A is given by the formula for the area of a circle, A = πr², where r is the radius of the circular cross-section. Here, r is specified as 0.5 cm, and π is approximated as 3.14. The calculation proceeds by squaring the radius (0.5 cm)² = 0.25 cm², multiplying by π to yield 0.785 cm², and then converting this area into square meters (0.785 × 10⁻⁴ m²) to maintain SI unit consistency. This conversion is crucial for subsequent calculations involving conductivity and resistivity, which are typically expressed in SI units. The variables are: A (cross-sectional area), r (radius of the column), π (mathematical constant approximately 3.14159). The operation involves exponentiation (squaring the radius), multiplication by a constant (π), and unit conversion. In the context of the surrounding material, this area is used to calculate electrical resistance and conductivity of electrolyte solutions in a conductivity cell, where the geometry of the cell directly affects the measured electrical properties.

The primary equation \\( R = \\frac{\\rho l}{A} \\) expresses the resistance of a column of electrolyte solution as a function of its resistivity \\( \\rho \\), length \\( l \\), and cross-sectional area \\( A \\). Rearranging gives resistivity \\( \\rho = \\frac{RA}{l} \\), which is calculated numerically here using given values: resistance \\( 5.55 \\times 10^3 \\ \\Omega \\), area \\( 0.785 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^2 \\), and length \\( 50 \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\), yielding \\( 87.135 \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm} \\). Conductivity \\( \\kappa \\) is the reciprocal of resistivity, \\( \\kappa = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\), resulting in approximately \\( 0.01148 \\ \\mathrm{S} \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\). These quantities are fundamental in characterizing ionic transport in solutions. The variables are defined as: \\( R \\) (electrical resistance in ohms), \\( \\rho \\) (resistivity in ohm-centimeters), \\( l \\) (length of the solution column in centimeters), \\( A \\) (cross-sectional area in square centimeters), and \\( \\kappa \\) (conductivity in siemens per centimeter). The operations include algebraic rearrangement and inversion (reciprocal) to relate resistance, resistivity, and conductivity. The context is the measurement of electrolyte solution properties, crucial in physical chemistry and electrochemistry for understanding ion mobility and concentration effects. The physical significance lies in quantifying how well an electrolyte solution conducts electric current, which depends on ion concentration, mobility, and solution geometry. This equation connects to molar conductivity concepts discussed in the surrounding text, where molar conductivity \\( \\Lambda_m \\) is derived from conductivity and concentration, reflecting the conductance per mole of electrolyte. Practical applications include designing conductivity cells, analyzing electrolyte strength, and quality control in chemical and industrial processes. Overall, this equation forms the quantitative basis for interpreting experimental resistance data to extract intrinsic electrical properties of electrolyte solutions within the broader framework of electrolyte conductivity and molar conductivity variation with concentration.", "full_doc_id": "doc-eb898d9882005d7ff285ccffcb4cd210", "file_path": "lech102.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-77317edb944aa486c3f6c6eba2b62f60", "__created_at__": 1762857906, "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { = \\begin{array} { l } { \\mathrm { 0 . 0 1 1 4 8 ~ S ~ c m ^ { - 1 } \\times 1 0 0 0 ~ c m ^ { 3 } ~ L ^ { - 1 } ~ } } \\\\ { \\mathrm { 0 . 0 5 ~ m o l ~ L ^ { - 1 } ~ } } \\end{array} } \\\\  = \\begin{array} { l } { \\mathrm { 2 2 9 . 6 ~ S ~ c m ^ { 2 } ~ m o l ^ { - 1 } ~ } } \\end{array} \\end{array}\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: The equation represents the calculation of molar conductivity (\\( \\Lambda_m \\)) of an electrolyte solution, expressed as \\( \\Lambda_m = \\frac{\\kappa \\times 1000}{c} \\), where \\( \\kappa \\) is the conductivity of the solution in siemens per centimeter (S cm^{-1}) and \\( c \\) is the concentration in moles per liter (mol L^{-1}).

The variables are: κ (conductivity, Siemens per cm), A (cross-sectional area of the cell, cm²), and l (distance between electrodes, cm). Since A = 1 cm² and l = 1 cm, the conductance simplifies directly to κ. This equation is fundamental in electrochemistry for relating measurable conductance to intrinsic conductivity, enabling calculation of molar conductivity and resistivity. It underpins the analysis of how conductivity varies with electrolyte concentration, crucial for characterizing strong and weak electrolytes. The equation connects to the broader framework of electrolyte solution behavior, facilitating interpretation of experimental data such as the variation of molar conductivity with concentration and the determination of limiting molar conductivity.

The graph plots molar conductivity (Λm) on the y-axis against the square root of concentration (c^1/2) on the x-axis. The y-axis is labeled with values ranging approximately from 0 to 400 S cm² mol⁻¹, and the x-axis ranges from 0 to about 0.1 (mol/L)^1/2. Two distinct curves are shown: one for acetic acid, a weak electrolyte, and one for potassium chloride (KCl), a strong electrolyte. The curve for KCl shows a nearly linear increase in molar conductivity as concentration decreases (moving left on the x-axis), consistent with the theory that molar conductivity increases slowly with dilution for strong electrolytes. The acetic acid curve shows a more pronounced increase in molar conductivity with dilution, reflecting the different behavior of weak electrolytes. The graph uses different colors or line styles to distinguish the two electrolytes, with clear data points marked along each curve. The background is white with grid lines to aid in reading values. The graph visually supports the surrounding text's explanation of how molar conductivity varies with concentration for strong and weak electrolytes, illustrating the theoretical concepts and equations discussed on pages 15 and 17. The lighting and style are typical of scientific publication graphs, with clear, sharp lines and legible fonts.

The second and fourth columns are empty, likely placeholders or formatting artifacts. The data shows molar conductivity values decreasing slightly as concentration increases from 0.000198 mol L-1 to 0.000989 mol L-1, with values ranging from 148.61 to 147.09 S cm2 mol-1. This trend aligns with the theoretical explanation that molar conductivity decreases with increasing concentration due to reduced ion mobility and increased ion interactions. The table supports the surrounding content's discussion on the relationship between molar conductivity (Λm) and concentration (c), particularly for strong electrolytes like KCl. It provides empirical data that can be used to plot Λm against the square root of concentration (c^1/2) to verify the linear relationship and determine limiting molar conductivity (Λm°) and the constant A, as described in the text.

Mathematically, it states that the difference between the limiting molar conductivity of KCl and NaCl equals that of KBr and NaBr, which also equals that of KI and NaI, approximately 23.4 S cm^2 mol^{-1}. Here, \\( \\mathring{\\Lambda}_m \\) denotes the limiting molar conductivity, representing the conductivity contribution per mole of electrolyte at infinite dilution where ion interactions are negligible. The variables correspond to specific electrolytes: KCl, NaCl, KBr, NaBr, KI, and NaI. The operations involve subtraction of scalar conductivity values, highlighting a linear relationship. This empirical regularity underpins Kohlrausch's law of independent migration of ions, which states that the limiting molar conductivity of an electrolyte is the sum of the individual ionic contributions. Physically, this reflects that the difference in conductivity arises primarily from the difference in cation mobilities (K^+ vs Na^+), as the anion is held constant. The equation is significant in electrochemistry and physical chemistry for understanding ionic transport and validating the additivity of ionic conductivities.

The notation \\( \\mathring{\\Lambda}_m \\) denotes the limiting molar conductivity, which is the molar conductivity at infinite dilution where ion interactions are negligible. The equation states that the difference between the limiting molar conductivities of NaBr and NaCl is approximately equal to the difference between those of KBr and KCl, both being about 1.8 S cm² mol⁻¹. This reflects a near-constant difference in conductivity contributions when substituting halide ions (Br⁻ vs Cl⁻) for a fixed cation (Na⁺ or K⁺), highlighting the additive and independent nature of ionic contributions to conductivity as per Kohlrausch's law of independent migration of ions. The variables \\( \\mathring{\\Lambda}_{m_{(X)}} \\) represent the limiting molar conductivity of electrolyte X. The mathematical operation is a simple difference between scalar conductivity values, emphasizing linear relationships. This equation is significant in physical chemistry and electrochemistry, providing insight into ion-specific conductivities and enabling the prediction of limiting molar conductivities of electrolytes from known ionic values. It supports the theoretical framework that the total limiting molar conductivity of an electrolyte is the sum of the individual ionic contributions, facilitating calculations for electrolytes where direct measurement is difficult.

The first column lists cations such as H⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, and Mg²⁺, while the third column lists anions including OH⁻, Cl⁻, Br⁻, and CH₃COO⁻. The λ values represent the limiting molar conductivities of individual ions at infinite dilution and 298 K, crucial for applying Kohlrausch's law of independent migration of ions. Key data points include the exceptionally high λ value for H⁺ (349.6 S cm² mol⁻¹) and OH⁻ (199.1 S cm² mol⁻¹), reflecting their high ionic mobility. Na⁺ and K⁺ ions show multiple λ values (50.1, 73.5, 119.0 S cm² mol⁻¹), possibly indicating different measurement conditions or sources. Mg²⁺ has a λ of 106.0 S cm² mol⁻¹, while common anions like Cl⁻ and Br⁻ have λ values of 76.3 and 78.1 S cm² mol⁻¹ respectively. The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) has a lower λ of 40.9 S cm² mol⁻¹, consistent with its larger size and lower mobility. The table supports the surrounding content by providing the fundamental ionic conductivity values needed to calculate limiting molar conductivities (Λₘ°) of electrolytes using Kohlrausch's law. This enables determination of Λₘ° for strong electrolytes like KCl and weak electrolytes like acetic acid, as discussed in the text. The data also illustrate the principle that the total limiting molar conductivity of an electrolyte is the sum of its constituent ions' λ values, underpinning the law of independent migration of ions. The table's values are essential for plotting Λₘ versus c¹/² to verify linearity and extract parameters such as Λₘ° and the constant A for KCl, as well as for calculating dissociation constants of weak electrolytes.", "full_doc_id": "doc-eb898d9882005d7ff285ccffcb4cd210", "file_path": "lech102.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-20496150a9c947a90ce4184cd4be8f9c", "__created_at__": 1762857906, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'C Electrochemistry ', 'bbox': [699, 901, 897, 917], 'page_idx': 18}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of a brief heading or title, 'C Electrochemistry', positioned on page 18.

The first equation defines the molar conductivity (\\( \\mathcal{A}_m \\)) as the ratio of the measured conductivity (\\( \\kappa \\)) to the molar concentration (\\( c \\)), adjusted by a volume conversion factor to yield units of S cm^2 mol^{-1}. This represents the conductivity contribution per mole of electrolyte. The second equation calculates the degree of dissociation (\\( \\alpha \\)) as the ratio of the molar conductivity at concentration \\( c \\) to the limiting molar conductivity at infinite dilution (\\( A_n^\\circ \\)), reflecting the fraction of electrolyte molecules dissociated into ions. The third equation computes the dissociation constant (\\( k \\)) using the formula \\( k = \\frac{c \\alpha^2}{1 - \\alpha} \\), derived from the equilibrium expression for weak acid dissociation, where \\( c \\) is the initial concentration and \\( \\alpha \\) the degree of dissociation. The variables are: \\( \\kappa \\) (conductivity in S cm^{-1}), \\( c \\) (concentration in mol L^{-1}), \\( \\mathcal{A}_m \\) (molar conductivity in S cm^2 mol^{-1}), \\( A_n^\\circ \\) (limiting molar conductivity at infinite dilution), \\( \\alpha \\) (degree of dissociation, dimensionless), and \\( k \\) (dissociation constant in mol L^{-1}). The mathematical operations include division, multiplication, and exponentiation, applied to physical chemistry concepts of ionic dissociation and conductivity. This analysis is situated within the domain of electrochemistry and solution chemistry, specifically the study of weak electrolytes and their ionization equilibria. The equations embody Kohlrausch's law of independent ionic migration, linking conductivity measurements to ionization extent and equilibrium constants. Practically, these relations enable determination of dissociation constants from experimental conductivity data, crucial for understanding acid-base equilibria, electrolyte behavior, and solution properties. Within the broader framework, these equations illustrate the application of Kohlrausch's law to weak electrolytes, bridging experimental conductivity data with theoretical dissociation models and facilitating quantitative analysis of electrolyte solutions.", "full_doc_id": "doc-eb898d9882005d7ff285ccffcb4cd210", "file_path": "lech102.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-147c31732ab284d066969970d0cea2b7", "__created_at__": 1762857906, "content": "Discarded Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'discarded', 'text': 'Chemistry ', 'bbox': [100, 900, 244, 917], 'page_idx': 19}\n\nAnalysis: The discarded content consists solely of the single word 'Chemistry' positioned on page 19, with no additional text or context.

Mathematically, it states that the total electric charge Q (measured in coulombs) passing through an electrolytic cell is the product of the constant current I (in amperes) and the duration t (in seconds) for which the current flows. Here, Q is the total charge transferred, I is the steady current supplied by an external source, and t is the elapsed time of electrolysis. This linear relationship is a direct consequence of the definition of electric current as the rate of flow of charge (I = dQ/dt). The equation is foundational in electrochemistry, particularly in quantifying the amount of substance deposited or dissolved at electrodes during electrolysis, as per Faraday's laws. It connects the macroscopic measurable quantities (current and time) to the microscopic transfer of electrons involved in redox reactions. The physical significance lies in enabling calculation of the moles of electrons transferred, which, combined with stoichiometric coefficients and Faraday's constant, allows determination of the mass of material altered at electrodes.

Variables include Cl⁻ (aqueous chloride ion), Cl₂ (chlorine gas), e⁻ (electron), H₂O (liquid water), O₂ (oxygen gas), and H⁺ (aqueous proton). The mathematical operations involve stoichiometric coefficients (e.g., 1/2 Cl₂, 4 H⁺, 4 e⁻) indicating mole ratios in redox half-reactions. The electrode potentials E° quantify the thermodynamic tendency for these oxidation processes under standard conditions. These equations are fundamental in electrochemistry, specifically in understanding competing anodic reactions during the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride solutions. The higher E° for chloride oxidation suggests it is less favorable thermodynamically than water oxidation, but kinetic factors such as overpotential can influence which reaction predominates. This relates to the Nernst equation and electrode kinetics discussed in the surrounding context. Practically, these reactions determine the products formed at the anode (Cl₂ gas or O₂ gas) in industrial electrolysis processes, impacting the design and control of electrolytic cells. The equations exemplify the interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics in electrochemical systems and illustrate how standard electrode potentials guide predictions of reaction feasibility and product formation in electrolytic reactions.", "full_doc_id": "doc-eb898d9882005d7ff285ccffcb4cd210", "file_path": "lech102.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-bcb953c690570219c20c048c5da990d5", "__created_at__": 1762857906, "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\n2 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } ( 1 ) \\to \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } ( \\mathrm { g } ) + 4 \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } ( \\mathrm { a q } ) + 4 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - } \\qquad E _ { ( \\mathrm { c e l l } ) } ^ { \\mathrm { o } } = + 1 . 2 3 ~ \\mathrm { V }\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: The equation represents the anodic half-reaction of water oxidation during electrolysis, where two liquid water molecules (2 H2O (l)) are converted into one molecule of oxygen gas (O2 (g)), four protons (4 H+ (aq)), and four electrons (4 e-).

Here, SO4^{2-} and S2O8^{2-} are aqueous ions, and e^- denotes electrons involved in the redox process. The reaction is an oxidation process where sulfate ions are oxidized to peroxodisulfate at the anode during electrolysis.

The space between the zinc container and the cathode mixture is filled with a moist paste of ammonium chloride and zinc chloride, depicted as a lighter shaded area, which acts as the electrolyte. The image uses clear labels and arrows to indicate the flow of electrons and ions during the electrochemical reactions. The graphite cathode is shown as a solid black rod, contrasting with the textured manganese dioxide-carbon mixture. The zinc container is illustrated with a metallic gray color and a slightly reflective surface to indicate its metal nature. The lighting and shading emphasize the cylindrical shape and the layered structure of the cell. The diagram is technical in style, with precise lines and annotations, suitable for educational purposes. The image relates directly to the surrounding text on page 22, which explains the chemical reactions occurring in the dry cell, including the oxidation of zinc at the anode and the reduction of manganese dioxide at the cathode.

The layout shows multiple layers rolled together in a cylindrical form, illustrating the internal structure of the cell. The central visual element is the spiral or jelly roll arrangement of the electrodes and separator. The electrodes consist of alternating layers of nickel hydroxide (cathode) and cadmium (anode) materials. Between these electrode layers is a separator soaked in a moist alkaline electrolyte, typically sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide solution, which is clearly indicated in the diagram. The separator layer is shown as a thin, permeable sheet that prevents direct contact between the anode and cathode while allowing ionic conduction. The image uses distinct colors to differentiate components: the nickel hydroxide cathode is often represented in a darker or bluish shade, the cadmium anode in a lighter or grayish tone, and the separator in a neutral or white color. The jelly roll is enclosed within a cylindrical casing, which is partially visible to provide context for the cell's physical form factor. The diagram includes labels identifying the key parts such as the nickel hydroxide cathode, cadmium anode, separator soaked in electrolyte, and the jelly roll structure itself. The visual style is technical and schematic, with clean lines and clear demarcations to emphasize the layered construction and functional components of the cell.

On the left side, hydrogen gas (H2) is introduced and flows towards the anode, which is depicted as a porous carbon electrode embedded with a catalyst such as finely divided platinum or palladium. The hydrogen molecules are shown splitting into protons (H+) and electrons (e-) at the anode. The protons pass through the electrolyte, which is a concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, while the electrons travel through an external circuit, generating electric current. On the right side, oxygen gas (O2) is introduced and flows towards the cathode, another porous carbon electrode with catalyst. At the cathode, oxygen molecules combine with the incoming electrons from the external circuit and the protons that have traversed the electrolyte to form water (H2O). The water produced is shown exiting the cell, highlighting the clean byproduct of the reaction. The diagram uses arrows to indicate the flow of gases, ions, and electrons, emphasizing the continuous operation of the cell as long as reactants are supplied. The color scheme includes blue for oxygen and water, red for hydrogen ions, and black or gray for electrodes and circuit components, with clear labels for each species and reaction step.

The composition is divided into several interconnected sections showing the microscopic and chemical interactions on the iron surface. At the center, a metallic iron surface is depicted with distinct anodic and cathodic regions. The anodic spot is marked where iron atoms lose electrons (oxidation), forming ferrous ions (Fe2+). These electrons travel through the metal to the cathodic spot, where oxygen from the atmosphere reacts with water and hydrogen ions (H+) to form hydroxide ions (OH-), representing the reduction reaction. The diagram includes arrows indicating electron flow from the anode to the cathode and ion movement in the electrolyte layer. Surrounding the iron surface, the presence of water (H2O) and dissolved oxygen (O2) is shown, emphasizing their role in the corrosion process. The formation of hydrated ferric oxide (Fe2O3.xH2O), commonly known as rust, is illustrated as a reddish-brown layer coating the iron surface, indicating the end product of the corrosion reaction. The image uses color coding: metallic iron is shown in gray, rust in reddish-brown, water in blue, and oxygen molecules in red and white. The lighting and style are schematic and educational, with clear labels and chemical equations adjacent to the relevant parts of the diagram. This visual representation directly relates to the surrounding text explaining the electrochemical nature of corrosion, the oxidation and reduction reactions involved, and the environmental factors contributing to rust formation.

Mathematically, it quantifies the voltage difference between the iron electrode and the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), which is assigned a potential of zero volts by convention. Here, $E^\\circ$ denotes the standard reduction potential measured under standard conditions (1 M concentration, 1 atm pressure, 25°C). The variable $E_{(\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}/Fe})}^\\circ$ specifically refers to the potential of the half-cell reaction: $\\mathrm{Fe^{2+} (aq) + 2e^- \\rightarrow Fe (s)}$. The negative value (-0.44 V) indicates that iron metal tends to oxidize (lose electrons) rather than reduce under standard conditions, making it a relatively active metal prone to corrosion. This electrode potential is fundamental in electrochemistry, particularly in understanding corrosion processes where iron acts as an anode, losing electrons to form ferrous ions. The equation relates to the broader discussion of electrochemical cells, redox reactions, and corrosion phenomena described in the context, linking thermodynamic properties (Gibbs free energy) to measurable electrical potentials. It also connects to the Nernst equation, which adjusts electrode potentials based on ion concentrations, and to practical applications such as corrosion prevention and fuel cell technology. The standard electrode potential serves as a benchmark for predicting the spontaneity of redox reactions involving iron and is crucial in designing electrochemical cells and protective strategies against rusting.", "full_doc_id": "doc-eb898d9882005d7ff285ccffcb4cd210", "file_path": "lech102.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-f397768a3ec3c306fb6fdc770296b2c6", "__created_at__": 1762857906, "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } { \\mathrm { : } \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } [ \\mathrm { g } ] + 4 \\mathrm { ~ H } ^ { + } [ \\mathrm { a q } ] + 4 \\mathrm { ~ e } ^ { - } \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm { ~ H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } \\left( \\mathrm { l } \\right) E _ { \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } | \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } | \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } } ^ { \\mathrm { o } } } & { { } = 1 . 2 3 \\mathrm { V } } \\end{array}\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: The equation represents the standard electrode half-reaction for the reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) to liquid water (H2O) in an acidic aqueous medium, involving protons (H+) and electrons (e-).

The reaction involves electron transfer and proton consumption, characteristic of electrochemical processes. This half-reaction is fundamental in fuel cell technology, particularly hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells, where it occurs at the cathode. The high positive standard potential indicates a strong driving force for oxygen reduction, contributing to the overall cell voltage and efficiency. The equation is related to the broader discussion of electrochemical cells, galvanic cells, and fuel cells converting chemical energy directly into electrical energy with high efficiency and low pollution.

The standard Gibbs free energy change, given as \\(-45.54\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}\\), quantifies the spontaneity of the reaction under standard conditions (1 bar, 298 K, 1 M concentrations). A negative value indicates the reaction proceeds spontaneously in the forward direction. The equilibrium constant \\( K_c = 9.62 \\times 10^{7} \\) is a dimensionless quantity representing the ratio of product to reactant concentrations at equilibrium, reflecting a strong product-favored equilibrium. These two quantities are mathematically related by the fundamental thermodynamic equation \\( \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}} G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K_c \\), where \\( R \\) is the universal gas constant and \\( T \\) the absolute temperature. Here, \\( \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}} G^{\\circ} \\) and \\( K_c \\) are consistent, confirming the reaction's thermodynamic favorability. The variables include \\( \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}} G^{\\circ} \\) (standard Gibbs free energy change), \\( K_c \\) (equilibrium constant), \\( R \\) (gas constant), and \\( T \\) (temperature in Kelvin). The equation arises in the context of redox reactions and galvanic cells, where calculating \\( \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}} G^{\\circ} \\) and \\( K_c \\) helps predict reaction spontaneity and equilibrium position. This relationship is fundamental in electrochemistry, chemical thermodynamics, and kinetics, providing insight into reaction feasibility, cell potential, and equilibrium composition. Practically, it aids in designing galvanic cells, batteries, and understanding corrosion and electrolysis processes.
