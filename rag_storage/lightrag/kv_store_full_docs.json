Most of these are mixtures containing two or more pure substances. Their utility or importance in life depends on their composition. For example, the properties of brass (mixture of copper and zinc) are quite different from those of German silver (mixture of copper, zinc and nickel) or bronze (mixture of copper and tin); 1 part per million (ppm) of fluoride ions in water prevents tooth decay, while $1 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { p p m }$ causes the tooth to become mottled and high concentrations of fluoride ions can be poisonous (for example, sodium fluoride is used in rat poison); intravenous injections are always dissolved in water containing salts at particular ionic concentrations that match with blood plasma concentrations and so on. \n\nIn this Unit, we will consider mostly liquid solutions and their formation. This wil be followed by studying the properties of the solutions, like vapour pressure and colligative properties. We will begin with types of solutions and then various alternatives in which concentrations of a solute can be expressed in liquid solution. \n\nSolutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more than two components. By homogenous mixture we mean that its composition and properties are uniform throughout the mixture. Generally, the component that is present in the largest quantity is known as solvent. Solvent determines the physical state in which solution exists. One or more components present in the solution other than solvent are called solutes. In this Unit we shall consider only binary solutions (i.e., consisting of two components). Here each component may be solid, liquid or in gaseous state and are summarised in Table 1.1. \n\nComposition of a solution can be described by expressing its concentration. The latter can be expressed either qualitatively or quantitatively. For example, qualitatively we can say that the solution is dilute (i.e., relatively very small quantity of solute) or it is concentrated (i.e., relatively very large quantity of solute). But in real life these kinds of description can add to lot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description of the solution. \n\nThere are several ways by which we can describe the concentration of the solution quantitatively. \n\n(i) Mass percentage (w/w): The mass percentage of a component of a solution is defined as: Mass $\\%$ of a component \n\nFor example, if a solution is described by $1 0 \\%$ glucose in water by mass, it means that $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of glucose is dissolved in $9 0 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ of water resulting in a $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ solution. Concentration described by mass percentage is commonly used in industrial chemical applications. For example, commercial bleaching solution contains 3.62 mass percentage of sodium hypochlorite in water. \n\n(ii) Volume percentage $( V / V )$ : The volume percentage is defined as: Volume $\\%$ of a component $=$ Volume of the component ×100 Total volume of solution \n\nFor example, $1 0 \\%$ ethanol solution in water means that $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { \\ m L }$ of ethanol is dissolved in water such that the total volume of the solution is $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m L } }$ . Solutions containing liquids are commonly expressed in this unit. For example, a $3 5 \\% ~ ( v / v )$ solution of ethylene glycol, an antifreeze, is used in cars for cooling the engine. At this concentration the antifreeze lowers the freezing point of water to 255.4K $\\left( - 1 7 . 6 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } \\right)$ . \n\n(ii) Mass by volume percentage $( \\mathbf { w } / V )$ : Another unit which is commonly used in medicine and pharmacy is mass by volume percentage. It is the mass of solute dissolved in $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m L }$ of the solution. \n\n(iv) Parts per million: When a solute is present in trace quantities, it is convenient to express concentration in parts per million (ppm) and is defined as: \n\nParts per million $=$ \n\nAs in the case of percentage, concentration in parts per million can also be expressed as mass to mass, volume to volume and mass to volume. A litre of sea water (which weighs 1030 g) contains about $6 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of dissolved oxygen $\\left( \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } \\right)$ . Such a small concentration is also expressed as $5 . 8 \\textrm { g }$ per $1 0 ^ { 6 } \\ \\mathrm { \\ g }$ (cid:) $( 5 . 8 \\mathrm { \\ p p m } )$ of sea water. The concentration of pollutants in water or atmosphere is often expressed in terms of $\\mu \\mathrm { g } \\ \\bar { \\mathrm { m L } } ^ { - 1 }$ or ppm. \n\n(v) Mole fraction: Commonly used symbol for mole fraction is $x$ and subscript used on the right hand side of $x$ denotes the component. It is defined as: \n\nMole fraction of a component = \n\nNumber of moles of the component \n\nTotal number of moles of all the components \n\nFor example, in a binary mixture, if the number of moles of A and B are $n _ { \\mathrm { A } }$ and $n _ { \\mathrm { { B } } }$ respectively, the mole fraction of A will be \n\nFor a solution containing i number of components, we have: \n\nIt can be shown that in a given solution sum of all the mole fractions is unity, i.e. \n\nMole fraction unit is very useful in relating some physical properties of solutions, say vapour pressure with the concentration of the solution and quite useful in describing the calculations involving gas mixtures. \n\nExample 1.1 \n\nCalculate the mole fraction of ethylene glycol $\\mathrm { ( C _ { 2 } H _ { 6 } O _ { 2 } ) }$ in a solution containing $2 0 \\%$ of $\\mathrm { C _ { 2 } H _ { 6 } O _ { 2 } }$ by mass. \n\nSolution Assume that we have $1 0 0 \\mathrm { g }$ of solution (one can start with any amount of solution because the results obtained will be the same). Solution will contain $2 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of ethylene glycol and $8 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of water. \n\nMolar mass of $\\mathrm { C _ { 2 } H _ { 6 } O _ { 2 } } = 1 2 \\times 2 + 1 \\times 6 + 1 6 \\times 2 = 6 2 \\mathrm { g \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ \n\nMoles of C2HO2 = $\\mathrm { C _ { 2 } H _ { 6 } O _ { 2 } = \\frac { 2 0 \\ g } { 6 2 \\ g \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } } = 0 . 3 2 2 \\ m o l }$ \n\nMoles of water $= { \\frac { 8 0 \\ \\mathrm { g } } { 1 8 \\ \\mathrm { g } \\ \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 } } } = 4 . 4 4 4 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }$ \n\nSimilarly, $x _ { \\mathrm { w a t e r } } = { \\frac { 4 . 4 4 4 ~ { \\bmod { } } ~ } { 0 . 3 2 2 ~ { \\bmod { } } ~ + ~ 4 . 4 4 4 ~ { \\bmod { } } ~ } } = 0 . 9 3 2$ Mole fraction of water can also be calculated as: $1 - 0 . 0 6 8 = 0 . 9 3 2$ \n\n(vi) Molarity: Molarity $[ M ]$ is defined as number of moles of solute dissolved in one litre (or one cubic decimetre) of solution, \n\nFor example, $0 . 2 5 \\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 }$ (or $0 . 2 5 \\mathrm { M }$ solution of NaOH means that 0.25 mol of NaOH has been dissolved in one litre (or one cubic decimetre). \n\nExample 1.2 \n\nCalculate the molarity of a solution containing $5 \\mathrm { g }$ of NaOH in 450 mL solution. \n\nSolution \n\nMoles of $\\mathrm { N a O H } = { \\frac { 5 \\mathrm { g } } { 4 0 \\mathrm { g } { \\mathrm { m o l } } ^ { - 1 } } } = 0 . 1 2 5 { \\mathrm { m o l } }$ \n\nVolume of the solution in litres $= 4 5 0 \\mathrm { m L } / 1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { m L L } ^ { - 1 }$ Using equation (2.8), \n\n(vii) Molality: Molality $( m )$ is defined as the number of moles of the solute per kilogram $\\mathrm { ( k g ) }$ of the solvent and is expressed as: \n\nFor example, $1 . 0 0 \\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 }$ (or $1 . 0 0 \\mathrm { m } )$ solution of KCl means that 1 mol (74.5 g) of KCl is dissolved in $1 ~ \\mathrm { k g }$ of water. \n\nEach method of expressing concentration of the solutions has its own merits and demerits. Mass $\\%$ , ppm, mole fraction and molality are independent of temperature, whereas molarity is a function of temperature. This is because volume depends on temperature and the mass does not. \n\nCalculate molality of $2 . 5 \\mathrm { g }$ of ethanoic acid $\\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } C O O H ) }$ in $7 5 \\mathrm { g }$ of benzene.

It depends upon the nature of solute and solvent as well as temperature and pressure. Let us consider the effect of these factors in solution of a solid or a gas in a liquid. \n\n1.3.1 Solubility of a Solid in a Liquid \n\nEvery solid does not dissolve in a given liquid. while sodium chloride and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do not. On the other hand, naphthalene and anthracene dissolve readily in benzene but sodium chloride and sugar do not. It is observed that polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents and non polar solutes in nonpolar solvents. In general, a solute dissolves in a solvent if the intermolecular interactions are similar in the two or we may say like dissolves like. \n\nwhen a solid solute is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves and its concentration increases in solution. This process is known as dissolution. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute particles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as crystallisation. A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the same rate. Under such conditions, number of 'solute particles going into solution will be equal to the solute particles separating out and a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached. \n\nSolute $^ +$ Solvent Solution \n\nAt this stage the concentration of solute in solution will remain constant under the given conditions, i.e., temperature and pressure. Similar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents. Such a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature and pressure is called a saturated solution. An unsaturated solution is one in which more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium with undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the maximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent. Thus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility. \n\nEarlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into another depends on the nature of the substances. In addition to these variables, two other parameters, i.e., temperature and pressure also control this phenomenon. \n\nEffect of temperature \n\nThe solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature changes. Consider the equilibrium represented by equation 1.10. This, being dynamic equilibrium, must follow Le Chateliers Principle. In general, if in a nearly saturated solution, the dissolution process is endothermic $( \\Delta _ { \\mathrm { s o l } } \\ \\mathrm { ~ H ~ } > \\ 0 )$ , the solubility should increase with rise in temperature and if it is exothermic $( \\Delta _ { \\mathrm { s o l } } \\ \\mathrm { H } < 0 )$ the solubility should decrease. These trends are also observed experimentally. \n\nEffect of pressure \n\nPressure does not have any significant effect on solubility of solids in liquids. It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible and practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure. \n\n1.3.2 Solubility of a Gas in a Liquid \n\nMany gases dissolve in water. Oxygen dissolves only to a small extent in water. It is this dissolved oxygen which sustains all aquatic life. On the other hand, hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) is highly soluble in water. Solubility of gases in liquids is greatly affected by pressure and temperature. The solubility of gases increase with increase of pressure. For solution of gases in a solvent, consider a system as shown in Fig. 1.1 (a). The lower part is solution and the upper part is gaseous system at pressure $p$ and temperature $T .$ Assume this system to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of gaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same. Now increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the gas to a smaller volume [Fig. 1.1 (b)]. This will increase the number of gaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate at which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to enter it. The solubility of the gas will increase until a new equilibrium is reached resulting in an increase in the pressure of a gas above the solution and thus its solubility increases. \n\nHenry was the first to give a quantitative relation between pressure and solubility of a gas in a solvent which is known as Henry's law. The law states that at a constant temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas present above the surface of liquid or solution. Dalton, a contemporary of Henry, also concluded independently that the solubility of a gas in a liquid solution is a function of partial pressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in the solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be said that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over the solution. The most commonly used form of Henry's law states that \"the partial pressure of the gas in vapour phase $\\pmb { \\left[ p \\right] }$ is proportional to the mole fraction of the gas $\\pmb { \\left\\{ x \\right\\} }$ in the solution\" and is expressed as: \n\nHere $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ is the Henry's law constant. If we draw a graph between partial pressure of the gas versus mole fraction of the gas in solution, then we should get a plot of the type as shown in Fig. 1.2. \n\nDifferent gases have different $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ values at the same temperature (Table 1.2). This suggests that $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ is a function of the nature of the gas. \n\nIt is obvious from equation (1.11) that higher the value of $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ at a given pressure, the lower is the solubility of the gas in the liquid. It can be seen from Table 1.2 that $\\mathrm { K } _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ values for both $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { { O } } _ { 2 }$ increase with increase of temperature indicating that the solubility of gases increases with decrease of temperature. It is due to this reason that aquatic species are more comfortable in cold waters rather than in warm waters. - \n\nExample 1.4 $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ gas is bubbled through water at $2 9 3 \\ \\mathrm { K }$ , how many millimoles of $\\mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ gas would dissolve in 1 litre of water? Assume that $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ exerts a partial pressure of O.987 bar. Given that Henry's law constant for $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ at 293 K is 76.48 kbar. - \n\nSolution The solubility of gas is related to the mole fraction in aqueous solution. The mole fraction of the gas in the solution is calculated by applying Henry's law. Thus: \n\nAs 1 litre of water contains $5 5 . 5 \\mathrm { m o l }$ of it, therefore if $n$ represents number of moles of $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ in solution, \n\n$x \\left( { \\mathrm { N i t r o g e n } } \\right) = { \\frac { n { \\mathrm { ~ m o l ~ } } } { n { \\mathrm { ~ m o l } } + 5 5 . 5 { \\mathrm { ~ m o l } } } } = { \\frac { n } { 5 5 . 5 } } = 1 . 2 9 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ (cd $n$ in denominator is neglected as it is $< < 5 5 . 5 ]$ (id:) Thus $n = 1 . 2 9 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \\times 5 5 . 5 \\mathrm { m o l } = 7 . 1 6 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \\mathrm { m o l }$ $= { \\frac { 7 . 1 6 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { - 4 } { \\mathrm { ~ m o l } } \\times 1 0 0 0 { \\mathrm { ~ m m o l } } } { \\mathrm { 1 ~ m o l } } } = 0 . 7 1 6 { \\mathrm { ~ m m o l } }$ \n\nHenry's law finds several applications in industry and explains some biological phenomena. Notable among these are: \n\n• To increase the solubility of $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in soft drinks and soda water, the bottle is sealed under high pressure. • Scuba divers must cope with high concentrations of dissolved gases while breathing air at high pressure underwater. Increased pressure increases the solubility of atmospheric gases in blood. when the divers come towards surface, the pressure gradually decreases. This releases the dissolved gases and leads to the formation of bubbles of nitrogen in the blood. This blocks capillaries and creates a medical condition known as bends, which are painful and dangerous to life. \n\nTo avoid bends, as well as, the toxic effects of high concentrations of nitrogen in the blood, the tanks used by scuba divers are filled with air diluted with helium $. 1 1 . 7 \\%$ helium, $5 6 . 2 \\%$ nitrogen and $3 2 . 1 \\%$ oxygen). \n\n• At high altitudes the partial pressure of oxygen is less than that at the ground level. This leads to low concentrations of oxygen in the blood and tissues of people living at high altitudes or climbers. Low blood oxygen causes climbers to become weak and unable to think clearly, symptoms of a condition known as anoxia. \n\nEffect of Temperature \n\nSolubility of gases in liquids decreases with rise in temperature. when dissolved, the gas molecules are present in liquid phase and the process of dissolution can be considered similar to condensation and heat is evolved in this process. We have learnt in the last Section that dissolution process involves dynamic equilibrium and thus must follow Le Chatelier's Principle. As dissolution is an exothermic process, the solubility should decrease with increase of temperature. \n\nIntexct Questions \n\n1.6 ${ \\mathrm { H } } _ { 2 } { \\mathsf { S } } _ { \\mathsf { \\ell } }$ , a toxic gas with rotten egg like smell, is used for the qualitative analysis. If the solubility of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S }$ in water at STP is $0 . 1 9 5 \\mathrm { m }$ , calculate Henry's law constant. \n\n1.7 Henry's law constant for $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in water is $1 . 6 7 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ Pa at 298 K. Calculate the quantity of $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in $5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m L }$ of soda water when packed under 2.5 atm $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ pressure at 298 K. \n\n1.4 Vapour Oressure of Liquid Solutions \n\nLiquid solutions are formed when solvent is a liquid. The solute can be a gas, a liquid or a solid. Solutions of gases in liquids have already been discussed in Section 1.3.2. In this Section, we shall discuss the solutions of liquids and solids in a liquid. Such solutions may contain one or more volatile components. Generally, the liquid solvent is volatile. The solute may or may not be volatile. We shall discuss the properties of only binary solutions, that is, the solutions containing two components, namely, the solutions of (i) liquids in liquids and (i) solids in liquids. \n\n1.4.1 Vapour Pressure of LiquidLiquid Solutions \n\nLet us consider a binary solution of two volatile liquids and denote the two components as 1 and 2. when taken in a closed vessel, both the components would evaporate and eventually an equilibrium would be established between vapour phase and the liquid phase. Let the total vapour pressure at this stage be $p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } }$ and $p _ { 1 }$ and $p _ { 2 }$ be the partial vapour pressures of the two components 1 and 2 respectively. These partial pressures are related to the mole fractions $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ of the two components 1 and 2 respectively. \n\nThe French chemist, Francois Marte Raoult (1886) gave the quantitative relationship between them. The relationship is known as the Raoult's law which states that for a solution of volatile liquids, the partial vapour pressure of each component of the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction present in solution. \n\nThus, for component 1 an $\\begin{array} { r l } & { p _ { 1 } \\propto x _ { 1 } } \\\\ { \\textrm { d } } & { p _ { 1 } = \\ p _ { 1 } ^ { 0 } \\ x _ { 1 } } \\end{array}$ \n\nwhere $p _ { 1 } ^ { 0 }$ is the vapour pressure of pure component 1 at the same temperature. \n\nSimilarly, for component 2 \n\nwhere ${ p _ { 2 } } ^ { 0 }$ represents the vapour pressure of the pure component 2. \n\nAccording to Dalton's law of partial pressures, the total pressure $( p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } } )$ over the solution phase in the container will be the sum of the partial pressures of the components of the solution and is given as: \n\nSubstituting the values of $p _ { 1 }$ and $p _ { 2 }$ , we get \n\nFollowing conclusions can be drawn from equation (1.16). \n\n(i) Total vapour pressure over the solution can be related to the mole fraction of any one component. \n\n(ii) Total vapour pressure over the solution varies linearly with the mole fraction of component 2. \n\n(ii) Depending on the vapour pressures of the pure components 1 and 2, total vapour pressure over the solution decreases or increases with the increase of the mole fraction of component 1. \n\nA plot of $p _ { 1 }$ or $p _ { 2 }$ versus the mole fractions $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ for a solution gives a linear plot as shown in Fig. 1.3. These lines (I and I) pass through the points for which $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ are equal to unity. Similarly the plot (line II) of $p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } }$ versus $x _ { 2 }$ is also linear (Fig. 1.3). The minimum value of $p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } }$ is ${ p _ { 1 } } ^ { 0 }$ and the maximum value is ${ p _ { 2 } } ^ { 0 }$ , assuming that component 1 is less volatile than component 2, i.e., ${ p _ { 1 } } ^ { 0 } < { p _ { 2 } } ^ { 0 }$ \n\nThe composition of vapour phase in equilibrium with the solution is determined by the partial pressures of the components. If $y _ { 1 }$ and $y _ { 2 }$ are the mole fractions of the components 1 and 2 respectively in the vapour phase then, using Dalton's law of partial pressures: \n\nIn general \n\nExample 1.5 \n\nVapour pressure of chloroform $\\mathrm { \\ t C H C l _ { 3 } } )$ and dichloromethane $\\mathrm { [ C H _ { 2 } C l _ { 2 } ] }$ at 298 K are $2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m \\ H g }$ and $4 1 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m \\ H g }$ respectively. (i) Calculate the vapour pressure of the solution prepared by mixing $2 5 . 5 \\textrm { g }$ of $\\mathrm { C H C l } _ { 3 }$ and $4 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ at 298 K and, (i) mole fractions of each component in vapour phase. \n\nTotal number of moles $= 0 . 4 7 + 0 . 2 1 3 = 0 . 6 8 3 ~ \\mathrm { m o l }$ \n\nUsing equation (2.16), \n\n(ii) Using the relation (2.19), $y _ { \\mathrm { { i } } } = p _ { \\mathrm { { i } } } / p _ { \\mathrm { { t o t a l } } }$ we can calculate the mole fraction of the components in gas phase $\\left( y _ { \\mathrm { i } } \\right)$ . \n\n$p _ { \\mathrm { C H _ { 2 } C l _ { 2 } } } = 0 . 6 8 8 \\times 4 1 5 \\mathrm { ~ m m ~ H g } = 2 8 5 . 5 \\mathrm { ~ m m ~ H g }$ $p _ { \\mathrm { C H C l _ { 3 } } } ~ = ~ 0 . 3 1 2 ~ \\times ~ 2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m ~ H g } ~ = ~ 6 2 . 4 ~ \\mathrm { m m ~ H g }$ $\\begin{array} { r l } & { y _ { \\mathrm { C H _ { 2 } C l _ { 2 } } } = 2 8 5 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\ \\mathrm { H g } / 3 4 7 . 9 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\ \\mathrm { H g } = 0 . 8 2 } \\\\ & { y _ { \\mathrm { C H C l _ { 3 } } } = 6 2 . 4 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\ \\mathrm { H g } / 3 4 7 . 9 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\ \\mathrm { H g } = 0 . 1 8 } \\end{array}$ (cid:) \n\nNote: Since, $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ is a more volatile component than $\\mathrm { C H C l } _ { 3 }$ , $\\mathrm { \\Gamma } [ p _ { \\mathrm { C H _ { 2 } C l _ { 2 } } } ^ { o } =$ (cid:) $4 1 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m \\ H g }$ and $p _ { \\mathrm { C H C l _ { 3 } } } ^ { o } = 2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m \\ H g } ]$ and the vapour phase is also richer in $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ (cid:) $\\mathrm { \\Delta } [ y _ { \\mathrm { C H _ { 2 } C l _ { 2 } } } = \\ 0 . 8 2$ and $y _ { \\mathrm { C H C l _ { 3 } } } = \\ 0 . 1 8 ]$ , it may thus be concluded that at equilibrium, vapour phase will be always rich in the component which is more volatile. \n\n1.4.2 Raoult's Law as a special case of Henry's Law \n\nAccording to Raoult's law, the vapour pressure of a volatile component in a given solution is given by $p _ { \\mathrm { { i } } } ^ { \\mathrm { { - } } } = x _ { \\mathrm { { i } } } ^ { \\mathrm { { } } } { p _ { \\mathrm { { i } } } ^ { \\mathrm { { 0 } } } }$ . In the solution of a gas in a liquid, one of the components is so volatile that it exists as a gas and we have already seen that its solubility is given by Henry's law which states that \n\nIf we compare the equations for Raoult's law and Henry's law, it can be seen that the partial pressure of the volatile component or gas is directly proportional to its mole fraction in solution. Only the proportionality constant $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ diff ers from ${ p _ { 1 } } ^ { 0 }$ . Thus, Raoult's law becomes a special case of Henry's law in which $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ becomes equal to ${ p _ { 1 } } ^ { 0 }$ . \n\n1.4.3 Vapour Pressure of Solutions of Solids in Liquids \n\nAnother important class of solutions consists of solids dissolved in liquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and cane sugar in water and iodine and sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide. Some physical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of pure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. Liquids at a given temperature vapourise and under equilibrium conditions the pressure exerted by the vapours of the liquid over the liquid phase is called vapour pressure [Fig. 1.4 (a)]. In 1a pure liquid the entire surface is occupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a non-volatile solute is added to a solvent to give a solution [Fig. 1.4.(b)], the vapour pressure of the solution is solely from the solvent alone. This vapour pressure of the solution at a given temperature is found to be lower than the vapour pressure of the pure solvent at the same temperature. In the solution, the surface has both solute and solvent molecules; thereby the fraction of the surface covered by the solvent molecules gets reduced. Consequently, the number of solvent molecules escaping from the surface is correspondingly reduced, thus, the vapour pressure is also reduced. \n\nThe decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the quantity of non-volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of its nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by adding $1 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }$ of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that produced by adding $1 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }$ of urea to the same quantity of water at the same temperature. \n\nRaoult's law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction. \n\nIn a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by 2. When the solute is non-volatile, only the solvent molecules are present in vapour phase and contribute to vapour pressure. Let $p _ { 1 }$ be the vapour pressure of the solvent, $x _ { 1 }$ be its mole fraction, ${ p } _ { \\mathrm { i } } ^ { 0 }$ be its vapour pressure in the pure state. Then according to Raoult's law \n\nThe proportionality constant is equal to the vapour pressure of pure solvent, $p _ { 1 } ^ { 0 }$ ; A plot between the vapour pressure and the mole fraction of the solvent is linear (Fig. 1.5). \n\n1.5 Ideal and Nonideal Solutions \n\n1.5.1 Ideal Solutions \n\nLiquid-liquid solutions can be classified into ideal and non-ideal solutions on the basis of Raoult's law. - \n\nThe solutions which obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration are known as ideal solutions. The ideal solutions have two other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the pure components to form the solution is zero and the volume of mixing is also zero, i.e., \n\nIt means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components are mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of volumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of the solutions can be explained by considering two components A and B. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will be of types A-A and B-B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition to these two interactions, A-B type of interactions will also be present. If the intermolecular attractive forces between the A-A and B-B are nearly equal to those between A-B, this leads to the formation of ideal solution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly ideal in behaviour. Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane, bromoethane and chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. fall into this category. \n\n1.5.2 Non-ideal Solutions \n\nWhen a solution does not obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration, then it is called non-ideal solution. The vapour pressure of such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by Raoult's law (equation 1.16). If it is higher, the solution exhibits positive deviation and if it is lower, it exhibits negative deviation from Raoult's law. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions for such solutions are shown in Fig. 1.6. \n\nThe cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the molecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult's law, A-B interactions are weaker than those between A-A or B-B, i.e., in this case the intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules are weaker than those between the solute-solute and solvent-solvent molecules. This means that in such solutions, molecules of A (or B) will find it easier to escape than in pure state. This will increase the vapour pressure and result in positive deviation. Mixtures of ethanol and acetone behave in this manner. In pure ethanol, molecules are hydrogen bonded. On adding acetone, its molecules get in between the host molecules and break some of the hydrogen bonds between them. Due to weakening of interactions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult's law [Fig. 1.6 (a)]. In a solution formed by adding carbon disulphide to acetone, the dipolar interactions between solute-solvent molecules are weaker than the respective interactions among the solute-solute and solvent-solvent molecules. This solution also shows positive deviation. \n\nIn case of negative deviations from Raoult's law, the intermolecular attractive forces between A-A and B-B are weaker than those between A-B and leads to decrease in vapour pressure resulting in negative deviations. An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline. In this case the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic proton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the respective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar molecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone forms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult's law. This is because chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen bond with acetone molecule as shown. \n\nThis decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each component and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting in negative deviation from Raoult's law [Fig. 1.6. (b)]. \n\nSome liquids on mixing, form azeotropes which are binary mixtures having the same composition in liquid and vapour phase and boil at a constant temperature. In such cases, it is not possible to separate the components by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes called minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling azeotrope. The solutions which show a large positive deviation from Raoult's law form minimum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. \n\nFor example, ethanol-water mixture (obtained by fermentation of sugars) on fractional distillation gives a solution containing approximately $9 5 \\%$ by volume of ethanol. Once this composition, known as azeotrope composition, has been achieved, the liquid and vapour have the same composition, and no further separation occurs. \n\nThe solutions that show large negative deviation from Raoult's law form maximum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. Nitric acid and water is an example of this class of azeotrope. This azeotrope has the approximate composition, $6 8 \\%$ nitric acid and $3 2 \\%$ water by mass, with a boiling point of 393.5 K. \n\nIntext Question \n\n1.8 The vapour pressure of pure liquids A and B are 450 and $7 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m \\ H g }$ respectively, at 350 K . Find out the composition of the liquid mixture if total vapour pressure is $6 0 0 \\mathrm { m m H g }$ Also find the composition of the vapour phase. \n\n1.6 Colligative Properties and Determination of Molar Mass \n\nWe have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of solution decreases when a non-volatile solute is added to a volatile solvent. There are many properties of solutions which are connected with this decrease of vapour pressure. These are: (1) relative lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent (2) depression of freezing point of the solvent (3) elevation of boiling point of the solvent and (4) osmotic pressure of the solution. All these properties depend on the number of solute particles irrespective of their nature relative to the total number of particles present in the solution. Such properties are called colligative properties (colligative: from Latin: co means together, ligare means to bind). In the following Sections we will discuss these properties one by one. \n\n1.6.1 Relative Lowering of Vapour Pressure \n\nWe have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of a solvent in solution is less than that of the pure solvent. Raoult established that the lowering of vapour pressure depends only on the concentration of the solute particles and it is independent of their identity. The equation (1.20) given in Section 1.4.3 establishes a relation between vapour pressure of the solution, mole fraction and vapour pressure of the solvent, i.e., \n\nThe reduction in the vapour pressure of solvent $( \\Delta p _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } )$ is given as: \n\nKnowing that $x _ { 2 } = 1 - x _ { 1 }$ , equation (1.23) reduces to \n\nIn a solution containing several non-volatile solutes, the lowering of the vapour pressure depends on the sum of the mole fraction of different solutes. \n\nEquation (1.24) can be written as \n\nThe expression on the left hand side of the equation as mentioned earlier is called relative lowering of vapour pressure and is equal to the mole fraction of the solute. The above equation can be written as: \n\nHere $n _ { 1 }$ and $n _ { 2 }$ are the number of moles of solvent and solute respectively present in the solution. For dilute solutions $n _ { 2 } < < n _ { 1 }$ , hence neglecting $n _ { 2 }$ in the denominator we have \n\nHere $w _ { 1 }$ and $w _ { 2 }$ are the masses and $M _ { 1 }$ and $M _ { 2 }$ are the molar masses of the solvent and solute respectively. \n\nFrom this equation (1.28), knowing all other quantities, the molar mass of solute $( M _ { 2 } )$ can be calculated. \n\nExample 1.6 \n\nThe vapour pressure of pure benzene at a certain temperature is 0.850 bar. A non-volatile, non-electrolyte solid weighing $0 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ when added to $3 9 . 0 \\mathrm { g }$ of benzene (molar mass $7 8 \\mathrm { g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ . Vapour pressure of the solution, then, is 0.845 bar. What is the molar mass of the solid substance? \n\nSolution The various quantities known to us are as follows: ${ p _ { 1 } } ^ { 0 } \\mathrm { ~ = ~ } 0 . 8 5 0$ bar; $ { p } = 0 . 8 4 5$ bar; $M _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } = 7 8 \\mathrm { g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { \\mathrm { - 1 } }$ ; $w _ { 2 } = 0 . 5 \\ : \\mathrm { g }$ i $w _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } = 3 9 \\ : \\mathrm { g }$ (cid:) Substituting these values in equation (2.28), we get \n\nTherefore, $M _ { 2 } = 1 7 0 \\mathrm { g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ \n\n1.6.2 Elevation of Boiling Point \n\nThe vapour pressure of a liquid increases with increase of temperature. It boils at the temperature at which its vapour pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at 373.15 K $\\mathrm { ( 1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } C ) }$ because at this temperature the vapour pressure of water is 1.013 bar (1 atmosphere). We have also learnt in the last section that vapour pressure of the solvent decreases in the presence of non-volatile solute. Fig. 1.7 depicts the variation of vapour pressure of the pure solvent and solution as a function of temperature. For example, the vapour pressure of an aqueous solution of sucrose is less than 1.013 bar at 373.15 K. In order to make this solution boil, its vapour pressure must be increased to 1.013 bar by raising the temperature above the boiling temperature of the pure solvent (water). Thus, the boiling point of a solution is always higher than that of the boiling point of the pure solvent in which the solution is prepared as shown in Fig. 1.7. Similar to lowering of vapour pressure, the elevation of boiling point also depends on the number of solute molecules rather than their nature. A solution of $1 \\ m 0 1$ of sucrose in $1 0 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of water boils at $3 7 3 . 5 2 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ at one atmospheric pressure. \n\nLet $T _ { \\mathrm { b } } ^ { 0 }$ be the boiling point of pure solvent and $T _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ be the boiling point of solution. The increase in the boiling point $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } } = T _ { \\mathrm { b } } - T _ { \\mathrm { b } } ^ { 0 }$ is known as elevation of boiling point. \n\nExperiments have shown that for dilute solutions the elevation of boiling point $( \\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } } )$ is directly proportional to the molal concentration of the solute in a solution. Thus \n\nHere $m$ (molality) is the number of moles of solute dissolved in $1 ~ \\mathrm { k g }$ of solvent and the constant of proportionality, $K _ { \\mathrm { { b } } }$ is called Boiling Point Elevation Constant or Molal Elevation Constant (Ebullioscopic Constant). The unit of $K _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ is $\\mathrm { K } \\mathrm { k g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ . Values of $K _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ for some common solvents are given in Table 1.3. If $\\mathbf { w } _ { 2 }$ gram of solute of molar mass $M _ { 2 }$ is dissolved in $\\mathbf { w } _ { 1 }$ gram of solvent, then molality, m of the solution is given by the expression: \n\nSubstituting the value of molality in equation (1.30) we get \n\nThus, in order to determine $M _ { 2 }$ , molar mass of the solute, known mass of solute in a known mass of the solvent is taken and $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ is determined experimentally for a known solvent whose $K _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ value is known. \n\n$1 8 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ of glucose, $\\mathrm { C _ { 6 } H _ { 1 2 } O _ { 6 } }$ , is dissolved in $1 ~ \\mathrm { k g }$ of water in a saucepan. At what temperature will water boil at 1.013 bar? $K _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ for water is 0.52 $\\mathrm { ~ K ~ k g ~ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ . \n\nExample 1.7 \n\nMoles of glucose $= 1 8 \\mathrm { \\ g / \\ 1 8 0 \\ g \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } = 0 . 1 \\ m o l }$ Number of kilograms of solvent $= 1 ~ \\mathrm { k g }$ Thus molality of glucose solution $= 0 . 1 \\mathrm { \\ m o l \\ k g ^ { - 1 } }$ For water, change in boiling point \n\n$\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } } = K _ { \\mathrm { b } } \\times m = 0 . 5 2 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ k g ~ m o l ^ { - 1 } ~ } \\times \\ : 0 . 1 \\mathrm { ~ m o l ~ k g ^ { - 1 } = 0 . 0 5 2 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ } }$ Since water boils at 373.15 K at 1.013 bar pressure, therefore, the boiling point of solution will be $3 7 3 . 1 5 + 0 . 0 5 2 = 3 7 3 . 2 0 2 \\mathrm { ~ K } .$ (id:) \n\nExample 1.8 \n\nThe boiling point of benzene is 353.23 K. When $1 . 8 0 \\ : \\mathrm { g }$ of a non-volatile solute was dissolved in $9 0 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ of benzene, the boiling point is raised to 354.11 K. Calculate the molar mass of the solute. $K _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ for benzene is 2.53 $\\mathrm { K } \\mathrm { k g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ (cid:) \n\nSolution \n\nThe elevation $( \\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } } )$ in the boiling point $= 3 5 4 . 1 1 \\mathrm { K } - 3 5 3 . 2 3 \\mathrm { K } = 0 . 8 8 \\mathrm { K }$ Substituting these values in expression (2.33) we get \n\nTherefore, molar mass of the solute, $M _ { 2 } = 5 8 \\mathrm { g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ \n\n1.6.3 Depression of Freezing Point \n\nThe lowering of vapour pressure of a solution causes a lowering of the freezing point compared to that of the pure solvent (Fig. 1.8). We know that at the freezing point of a substance, the solid phase is in dynamic equilibrium with the liquid phase. Thus, the freezing point of a substance may be defined as the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the substance in its liquid phase is equal to its vapour pressure in the solid phase. A solution will freeze when its vapour pressure equals the vapour pressure of the pure solid solvent as is clear from Fig. 1.8. According to Raoult's law, when a non-volatile solid is added to the solvent its vapour pressure decreases and now it would become equal to that of solid solvent at lower temperature. Thus, the freezing point of the solvent decreases. \n\nLet $T _ { \\mathrm { f } } ^ { 0 }$ be the freezing point of pure solvent and $T _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ be its freezing point when non-volatile solute is dissolved in it. The decrease in freezing point. \n\n$\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } } = T _ { \\mathrm { f } } ^ { 0 } - T _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ is known as depression in freezing point. \n\nSimilar to elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point $( \\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } } )$ for dilute solution (ideal solution) is directly proportional to molality, m of the solution. Thus, \n\nor \n\nThe proportionality constant, $\\mathrm { K } _ { \\mathrm { f } } ,$ which depends on the nature of the solvent is known as Freezing Point Depression Constant or Molal \n\nDepression Constant or Cryoscopic Constant. The unit of $\\mathrm { K _ { f } }$ is $\\textrm { K k g }$ $\\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ . Values of $K _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ for some common solvents are listed in Table 1.3. \n\nIf $\\mathbf { w } _ { 2 }$ gram of the solute having molar mass as $M _ { 2 }$ , present in $\\mathbf { w } _ { 1 }$ gram of solvent, produces the depression in freezing point $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ of the solvent then molality of the solute is given by the equation (1.31). \n\nSubstituting this value of molality in equation (1.34) we get: \n\nThus for determining the molar mass of the solute we should know the quantities $\\mathbf { W } _ { 1 } , \\mathbf { W } _ { 2 } , \\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } } ,$ along with the molal freezing point depression constant. \n\nThe values of $K _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ and $K _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ which depend upon the nature of the solvent, can be ascertained from the following relations. \n\nHere the symbols $R$ and $M _ { 1 }$ stand for the gas constant and molar mass of the solvent, respectively and $T _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ and $T _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ denote the freezing point and the boiling point of the pure solvent respectively in kelvin. Further, $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { f u s } } H$ and $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { v a p } } H$ represent the enthalpies for the fusion and vapourisation of the solvent, respectively. \n\nExample 1.9 \n\nSolution \n\n$4 5 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of ethylene glycol $\\mathrm { ( C _ { 2 } H _ { 6 } O _ { 2 } ) }$ is mixed with $6 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of water. Calculate (a) the freezing point depression and (b) the freezing point of the solution. Depression in freezing point is related to the molality, therefore, the molality moles of ethylene glycol of the solution with respect to ethylene glyol $=$ mass of water in kilogram $\\mathrm { M o l e s \\ o f \\ e t h y l e n e \\ g l y c o l = { \\frac { 4 5 \\ g } { 6 2 \\ g \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } } } = 0 . 7 3 \\ m o l }$   \nMass of water in kg = 1000g kg-1 $\\mathrm { k g = \\frac { 6 0 0 g } { 1 0 0 0 g \\ k g ^ { - 1 } } = 0 . 6 \\ k g }$   \n${ \\mathrm { H e n c e ~ m o l a l i t y ~ o f ~ e t h y l e n e ~ g l y c o l } } = { \\frac { 0 . 7 3 ~ { \\mathrm { m o l } } } { 0 . 6 0 ~ { \\mathrm { k g } } } } = 1 . 2 ~ { \\mathrm { m o l } } ~ { \\mathrm { k g ^ { - 1 } } }$   \nTherefore freezing point depression, ed $\\ddot { \\mathrm { A } } T _ { \\mathrm { f } } = 1 . 8 6 \\mathrm { ~ K } \\mathrm { k g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 } \\times 1 . 2 \\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 } = 2 . 2 \\mathrm { K }$   \nFreezing point of the aqueous solution $= 2 7 3 . 1 5 \\mathrm { K } - 2 . 2 \\mathrm { K } = 2 7 0 . 9 5 \\mathrm { K }$ \n\nExample 1.10 \n\n$1 . 0 0 \\mathrm { g }$ of a non-electrolyte solute dissolved in $5 0 \\mathrm { g }$ of benzene lowered the freezing point of benzene by O.40 K. The freezing point depression constant of benzene is $5 . 1 2 \\mathrm { K } \\mathrm { k g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ Find the molar mass of the solute. \n\nSolution \n\nSubstituting the values of various terms involved in equation (1.36) we get, \n\n1.6.4 0smosis and Osmotic Pressure \n\nThere are many phenomena which we observe in nature or at home. For example, raw mangoes shrivel when pickled in brine (salt water); wilted flowers revive when placed in fresh water, blood cells collapse when suspended in saline water, etc. If we look into these processes we \n\nfind one thing common in all, that is, all these substances are bound by membranes. These membranes can be of animal or vegetable origin and these occur naturally such as pig's bladder or parchment or can be synthetic such as cellophane. These membranes appear to be continuous sheets or films, yet they contain a network of submicroscopic holes or pores. Small solvent \n\nmolecules, like water, can pass through these holes but the passage of bigger molecules like solute is hindered. Membranes having this kind of properties are known as semipermeable membranes (SPM). \n\nAssume that only solvent molecules can pass through these semipermeable membranes. If this membrane is placed between the solvent and solution as shown in Fig. 1.9, the solvent molecules will flow through the membrane from pure solvent to the solution. This process of flow of the solvent is called osmosis. \n\nThe flow will continue till the equilibrium is attained. The flow of the solvent from its side to solution side across a semipermeable membrane can be stopped if some extra pressure is applied on the solution. This pressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called osmotic pressure of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to the concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to osmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules always flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution. The osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration of the solution. \n\nThe osmotic pressure of a solution is the excess pressure that must be applied to a solution to prevent osmosis, i.e., to stop the passage of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane into the solution. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.10. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property as it depends on the number of solute molecules and not on their identity. For dilute solutions, it has been found experimentally that osmotic pressure is proportional to the molarity, $\\pmb { c }$ of the solution at a given temperature $\\pmb { T }$ Thus: \n\nHere $\\Pi$ is the osmotic pressure and $\\mathrm { R }$ is the gas constant. \n\nHere $V$ is volume of a solution in litres containing $\\mathbf { n } _ { 2 }$ moles of solute. If $\\mathbf { w } _ { 2 }$ grams of solute, of molar mass, $M _ { 2 }$ is present in the solution, then $n _ { 2 } = \\mathrm { w } _ { 2 } \\ / \\ M _ { 2 }$ and we can write, \n\nThus, knowing the quantities $\\mathbf { w } _ { 2 }$ , $T , \\Pi$ and $V$ we can calculate the molar mass of the solute. \n\nMeasurement of osmotic pressure provides another method of determining molar masses of solutes. This method is widely used to determine molar masses of proteins, polymers and other macromolecules. The osmotic pressure method has the advantage over other methods as pressure measurement is around the room temperature and the molarity of the solution is used instead of molality. As compared to other colligative properties, its magnitude is large even for very dilute solutions. The technique of osmotic pressure for determination of molar mass of solutes is particularly useful for biomolecules as they are generally not stable at higher temperatures and polymers have poor solubility. \n\nTwo solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given temperature are called isotonic solutions. When such solutions are separated by semipermeable membrane no osmosis occurs between them. For example, the osmotic pressure associated with the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/volume) sodium chloride solution, called normal saline solution and it is safe to inject intravenously. On the other hand, if we place the cells in a solution containing more than $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/ volume) sodium chloride, water will flow out of the cells and they would shrink. Such a solution is called hypertonic. If the salt concentration is less than $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/volume), the solution is said to be hypotonic. In this case, water will flow into the cells if placed in this solution and they would swell. • \n\nExample 1.11 \n\n$2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m ^ { 3 } }$ of an aqueous solution of a protein contains $1 . 2 6 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of the protein. The osmotic pressure of such a solution at $3 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { K }$ is found to be $2 . 5 7 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ bar. Calculate the molar mass of the protein. \n\nSolution \n\nThe various quantities known to us are as follows: $\\Pi = 2 . 5 7 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ bar, \n\nSubstituting these values in equation (2.42) we get \n\nThe phenomena mentioned in the beginning of this section can be explained on the basis of osmosis. A raw mango placed in concentrated salt solution loses water via osmosis and shrivel into pickle. Wilted flowers revive when placed in fresh water. A carrot that has become limp because of water loss into the atmosphere can be placed into the water making it firm once again. Water will move into its cells through osmosis. When placed in water containing less than $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/ volume) salt, blood cells swell due to flow of water in them by osmosis. People taking a lot of salt or salty food experience water retention in tissue cells and intercellular spaces because of osmosis. The resulting puffiness or swelling is called edema. Water movement from soil into plant roots and subsequently into upper portion of the plant is partly due to osmosis. The preservation of meat by salting and of fruits by adding sugar protects against bacterial action. Through the process of osmosis, a bacterium on salted meat or candid fruit loses water, shrivels and dies. \n\n1.6.5 Reverse Osmosis and water Purification \n\nThe direction of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure larger than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution side. That is, now the pure solvent flows out of the solution through the semi permeable membrane. This phenomenon is called reverse osmosis and is of great practical utility. Reverse osmosis is used in desalination of sea water. A schematic set up for the process is shown in Fig. 1.11. \n\nWhen pressure more than osmotic pressure is applied, pure water is squeezed out of the sea water through the membrane. A variety of polymer membranes are available for this purpose. \n\nThe pressure required for the reverse osmosis is quite high. A workable porous membrane is a film of cellulose acetate placed over a suitable support. Cellulose acetate is permeable to water but impermeable to impurities and ions present in sea water. These days many countries use desalination plants to meet their potable water requirements. \n\nIntext Questions \n\n1.9 Vapour pressure of pure water at $2 9 8 \\ \\mathrm { K }$ is $2 3 . 8 ~ \\mathrm { m m ~ H g . ~ 5 0 ~ g }$ of urea (cid:) $\\mathrm { ( N H _ { 2 } C O N H _ { 2 } ) }$ is dissolved in $8 5 0 \\mathrm { g }$ of water.

For example, if we dissolve one mole of KCl $( 7 4 . 5 \\mathrm { g } )$ in water, we expect one mole each of $\\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ and $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ ions to be released in the solution. If this happens, there would be two moles of particles in the solution. If we ignore interionic attractions, one mole of KCl in one $\\mathbf { k } \\mathbf { g }$ of water would be expected to increase the boiling point by $2 \\times 0 . 5 2 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ } = \\mathrm { ~ 1 . 0 4 ~ K ~ }$ Now if we did not know about the degree of dissociation, we could be led to conclude that the mass of $2 \\mathrm { m o l }$ particles is $7 4 . 5 \\textrm { g }$ and the mass of one mole of KCl would be $\\mathrm { 3 7 . 2 5 ~ g } .$ This brings into light the rule that, when there is dissociation of solute into ions, the experimentally determined molar mass is always lower than the true value. \n\n2 $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { C O O H }  ( \\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { C O O H } ) _ { 2 }$ H₃C-C OH-0 O-H0 C−CH \n\nMolecules of ethanoic acid (acetic acid) dimerise in benzene due to hydrogen bonding.

The molar mass calculated on the basis of this $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ or $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ will, therefore, be twice the expected value. Such a molar mass that is either lower or higher than the expected or normal value is called as abnormal molar mass. \n\nIn l880 van't Hoff introduced a factor i, known as the van't Hoff factor, to account for the extent of dissociation or association. This factor i is defined as: - \n\nNormal molar mass Abnormal molar mass blis Observed colligative property Calculated colligative property i Total number of moles of particles after association/dissociation Number of moles of particles before association/dissociation \n\nHere abnormal molar mass is the experimentally determined molar mass and calculated colligative properties are obtained by assuming that the non-volatile solute is neither associated nor dissociated. In case of association, value of i is less than unity while for dissociation it is greater than unity. For example, the value of i for aqueous KCl solution is close to 2, while the value for ethanoic acid in benzene is nearly 0.5. \n\nInclusion of van't Hoff factor modifies the equations for colligative properties as follows: \n\nRelative lowering of vapour pressure of solvent, \n\nElevation of Boiling point, $\\Delta T _ { b } ^ { \\mathrm { ~ = ~ } i \\mathrm { ~ } K _ { b } }$ m Depression of Freezing point, $\\Delta T _ { f } = \\ i \\ K _ { f } \\ \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ Osmotic pressure of solution, $\\Pi \\ = \\ i \\ n _ { 2 } \\ R \\ T \\ / \\ V$ \n\nTable 1.4 depicts values of the factor, i for several strong electrolytes. For KCl, NaCl and $\\mathrm { M g S O _ { 4 } }$ , i values approach 2 as the solution becomes very dilute. As expected, the value of $_ i$ gets close to 3 for $\\mathrm { { K _ { 2 } S O _ { 4 } } }$ \n\nExample 1.12 \n\n$_ { 2 \\mathrm { ~ g ~ } }$ of benzoic acid $\\mathrm { ( C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } C O O H ) }$ dissolved in $2 5 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of benzene shows a depression in freezing point equal to $1 . 6 2 \\mathrm { K }$ . Molal depression constant for benzene is $4 . 9 \\mathrm { K } \\mathrm { k g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ . What is the percentage association of acid if it forms dimer in solution? \n\nThe given quantities are: $\\mathrm { w } _ { 2 } = 2 \\ : \\mathrm { g } ; \\ : K _ { \\mathrm { f } } = 4 . 9 \\ : \\mathrm { K } \\ : \\mathrm { k g } \\ : \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ ; $\\mathbf { w } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } = 2 5 \\ : \\mathrm { g }$ \n\nSolution \n\nSubstituting these values in equation (1.36) we get: \n\nThus, experimental molar mass of benzoic acid in benzene is $= 2 4 1 . 9 8 \\ \\mathrm { g \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ (cid \n\nNow consider the following equilibrium for the acid: \n\nIf $x$ represents the degree of association of the solute then we would have $\\left( 1 ~ - ~ x \\right)$ mol of benzoic acid left in unassociated form and correspondingly $\\frac x 2$ as associated moles of benzoic acid at equilibrium. Therefore, total number of moles of particles at equilibrium is: \n\nThus, total number of moles of particles at equilibrium equals van't Hoff factor i. \n\nTherefore, degree of association of benzoic acid in benzene is $9 9 . 2 \\%$ \n\nExample 1.13 \n\n$0 . 6 ~ \\mathrm { m L }$ of acetic acid $\\mathrm { \\small { ( C H _ { 3 } C O O H ) } }$ , having density $1 . 0 6 \\ \\mathrm { g \\ m L ^ { - 1 } }$ , is dissolved in 1 litre of water. The depression in freezing point observed for this strength of acid was $0 . 0 2 0 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . Calculate the van't Hoff factor and the dissociation constant of acid. \n\nSolution Number of moles of acetic acid 0.6 mL × 1.06 g mL-1 60 g mo1-1 $\\mathrm { M o l a l i t y } = { \\frac { 0 . 0 1 0 6 { \\ m o l } } { 1 0 0 0 { \\ m L } \\times 1 \\ \\mathrm { g \\ m L } ^ { - 1 } } } = 0 . 0 1 0 6 \\ \\mathrm { m o l \\ k g ^ { - 1 } }$ $= 0 . 0 1 0 6 ~ \\mathrm { m o l } = n$ sned Using equation (1.35) $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } } = 1 . 8 6 \\mathrm { K } \\mathrm { k g } \\mathrm { m o l ^ { - 1 } } \\times 0 . 0 1 0 6 \\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { k g ^ { - 1 } } = 0 . 0 1 9 7 \\mathrm { K }$ var $\\mathrm { ` t ~ H o f f F a c t o r } \\left( \\vartheta = \\frac { \\mathrm { O b s e r v e d ~ f r e e z i n g ~ p o i n t } } { \\mathrm { C a l c u l a t e d ~ f r e e z i n g ~ p o i n t } } = \\frac { 0 . 0 2 0 5 ~ \\mathrm { ~ K } } { 0 . 0 1 9 7 ~ \\mathrm { K } } = 1 . 0 4 1 \\right.$ Acetic acid is a weak electrolyte and will dissociate into two ions: acetate and hydrogen ions per molecule of acetic acid. If $x$ is the degree of dissociation of acetic acid, then we would have n $( 1 - x )$ moles of undissociated acetic acid, nx moles of $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C O O ^ { - } }$ and $n x$ moles of $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ ions, \n\nThus total moles of particles are: $n ( 1 - x + x + x ) = n ( 1 + x )$ \n\nThus degree of dissociation of acetic acid $= x = 1 . 0 4 1 - 1 . 0 0 0 = 0 . 0 4 1$ \n\nA solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. Solutions are classified as solid, liquid and gaseous solutions. The concentration of a solution is expressed in terms of mole fraction, molarity, molality and in percentages. The dissolution of a gas in a liquid is governed by Henry's law, according to which, at a given temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas. The vapour pressure of the solvent is lowered by the presence of a non-volatile solute in the solution and this lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent is governed by Raoult's law, according to which the relative lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent over a solution is equal to the mole fraction of a non-volatile solute present in the solution. However, in a binary liquid solution, if both the components of the solution are volatile then another form of Raoult's law is used. Mathematically, this form of the Raoult's law is stated as: $p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } } = p _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } ^ { \\mathrm { 0 } } x _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } + p _ { \\mathrm { 2 } } ^ { \\mathrm { 0 } } x _ { \\mathrm { 2 } }$ . Solutions which obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration are called ideal solutions. Two types of deviations from Raoult's law, called positive and negative deviations are observed. Azeotropes arise due to very large deviations from Raoult's law. \n\nThe properties of solutions which depend on the number of solute particles and are independent of their chemical identity are called colligative properties. These are lowering of vapour pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point and osmotic pressure. The process of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure higher than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution. Colligative properties have been used to determine the molar mass of solutes. Solutes which dissociate in solution exhibit molar mass lower than the actual molar mass and those which associate show higher molar mass than their actual values. \n\nQuantitatively, the extent to which a solute is dissociated or associated can be expressed by van't Hoff factor i. This factor has been defined as ratio of normal molar mass to experimentally determined molar mass or as the ratio of observed colligative property to the calculated colligative property. \n\n1.1 Define the term solution.

    "content": "Objectives \n\nAfter studying this Unit, you will be able to \n\n● describe an electrochemical cell and differentiate between galvanic and electrolytic cells; apply Nernst equation for calculating the emf of galvanic cell and define standard potential of the cell;   \n• derive relation between standard potential of the cell, Gibbs energy of cell reaction and its equilibrium constant; define resistivity (p), conductivity (k) and molar conductivity $\\left( \\boldsymbol { \\Lambda } _ { \\boldsymbol { m } } \\right)$ of ionic solutions; differentiate between ionic (electrolytic) and electronic conductivity; describe the method for measurement of conductivity of electrolytic solutions and calculation of their molar conductivity; justify the variation of conductivity and molar conductivity of solutions with change in their concentration and define $A _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ (molar conductivity at zero concentration or infinite dilution); enunciate Kohlrausch law and learn its applications; understand quantitative aspects of electrolysis; describe the construction of some primary and secondary batteries and fuel cells; explain corrosion as an elertrochemical nrocess \n\nChemical reactions can be used to produce electrical energy, conversely, electrical energy can be used to carry out chemical reactions that do not proceed spontaneously. \n\nElectrochemistry is the study of production of electricity from energy released during spontaneous chemical reactions and the use of electrical energy to bring about non-spontaneous chemical transformations. The subject is of importance both for theoretical and practical considerations. A large number of metals, sodium hydroxide, chlorine, fluorine and many other chemicals are produced by electrochemical methods. Batteries and fuel cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy and are used on a large scale in various instruments and devices. The reactions carried out electrochemically can be energy efficient and less polluting. Therefore, study of electrochemistry is important for creating new technologies that are ecofriendly. The transmission of sensory signals through cells to brain and vice versa and communication between the cells are known to have electrochemical origin. Electrochemistry, is therefore, a very vast and interdisciplinary subject. In this Unit, we will cover only some of its important elementary aspects. \n\nWe had studied the construction and functioning of Daniell cell (Fig. 2.1). This cell converts the chemical energy liberated during the redox reaction \n\nElectron flow \n\nto electrical energy and has an electrical potential equal to $1 . 1 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ when concentration of $Z \\mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ and $\\mathrm { \\Delta C u ^ { 2 + } }$ ions is unity $( 1 ~ \\mathrm { m o l } ~ \\mathrm { d m } ^ { - 3 } ) ^ { * }$ Such a device is called a galvanic or a voltaic cell. \n\nIf an external opposite potential is applied in the galvanic cell [Fig. 2.2(a)] and increased slowly, we find that the reaction continues to take place till the opposing voltage reaches the value $1 . 1 \\mathrm { V }$ [Fig. 2.2(b)] when, the reaction stops altogether and no current flows through the cell. Any further increase in the external potential again starts the reaction but in the opposite direction [Fig. 2.2(c)]. It now functions as an electrolytic cell, a device for using electrical energy to carry non-spontaneous chemical reactions. Both types of cells are quite important and we shall study some of their salient features in the following pages. \n\nWhen $\\mathrm { E } _ { \\mathrm { e x t } } = 1 . 1 ~ \\mathrm { V }$ (i) No flow of electrons or current.   \n(ii No chemical reaction. \n\nWhen $\\mathrm { E } _ { \\mathrm { e x t } } < 1 . 1$ V (i) Electrons flow from Zn rod to Cu rod hence current flows from Cu to Zn. (ii) $Z \\mathrm { n }$ dissolves at anode and copper deposits at cathode. \n\nAs mentioned earlier a galvanic cell is an electrochemical cell that converts the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction into electrical energy. In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for running a motor or other electrical gadgets like heater, fan, geyser, etc. \n\nDaniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following redox reaction occurs. \n\nThis reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition gives the overall cell reaction: \n\nThese reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell. The reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the oxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions of the cell are also called half-cells or redox couples. The copper electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode, the oxidation half-cell. \n\nWe can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each halfcell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two half-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1. Sometimes, both the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we do not require a salt bridge. \n\nAt each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make it positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode have a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the electrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At equilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively or negatively charged with respect to the solution. A potential difference develops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called electrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved in a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard electrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other half-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a positive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a potential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the switch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of electron flow. \n\nThe potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic cell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell potential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive force (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and the cathode on the right while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal and electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the halfcell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the left hand side i.e., \n\nThis is illustrated by the following example: \n\nCell reaction: \n\nHalf-cell reactions: \n\nIt can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction (2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as: \n\nThe potential of individual half-cell cannot be measured. We can measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one electrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect to this. According to convention, a half-cell called standard hydrogen electrode (Fig.3.3) represented by $\\mathrm { P t ( \\bar { s } ) } \\mid \\mathrm { H _ { 2 } ( g ) } \\mid \\mathrm { H ^ { + } ( a q ) }$ , is assigned a zero potential at all temperatures corresponding to the reaction \n\nThe standard hydrogen electrode consists of a platinum electrode coated with platinum black. The electrode is dipped in an acidic solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled through it. The concentration of both the reduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is maintained at unity (Fig. 2.3). This implies that the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar and the concentration of hydrogen ion in the solution is one molar. \n\nAt 298 K the emf of the cell, standard hydrogen electrode Il second half-cell constructed by taking standard hydrogen electrode as anode (reference half-cell) and the other half-cell as cathode, gives the reduction potential of the other half-cell. If the concentrations of the oxidised and the reduced forms of the species in the right hand half-cell are unity, then the cell potential is equal to standard electrode potential, $E _ { \\mathrm { ~ \\tiny ~ R ~ } } ^ { \\mathrm { 0 } }$ of the given half-cell. \n\nAs $\\boldsymbol { E } _ { \\mathrm { ~ L ~ } } ^ { 0 }$ for standard hydrogen electrode is zero. \n\nThe measured emf of the cell: \n\n$\\mathrm { P t ( s ) } \\mid \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } ( \\mathrm { g } , \\mathrm { ~ 1 ~ b a r } ) \\mid \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } ( \\mathrm { a q } , \\mathrm { ~ 1 ~ M } ) \\mid \\mid \\mathrm { C u } ^ { 2 + }$ (aq, 1 M) | Cu \n\nis $0 . 3 4 \\mathrm { V }$ and it is also the value for the standard electrode potential of the half-cell corresponding to the reaction: \n\nSimilarly, the measured emf of the cell: \n\n$\\mathrm { { P t ( s ) } \\mid \\ H _ { 2 } ( g , \\ l \\ b a r ) \\mid \\ H ^ { + } ( a q , \\ l \\ M ) \\mid \\mid \\ Z n ^ { 2 + } }$ (aq, 1M) |Zn \n\nis $- 0 . 7 6 \\mathrm { V }$ corresponding to the standard electrode potential of the half-cell reaction: 1 \n\nThe positive value of the standard electrode potential in the first case indicates that $\\mathrm { { C u } ^ { 2 + } }$ ions get reduced more easily than $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ ions. The reverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu (or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion) under the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not dissolve in HCl. In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by hydrogen ion. The negative value of the standard electrode potential in the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or zinc can reduce hydrogen ions). \n\nIn view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in Fig. 2.1 can be written as: \n\nLeft electrode: $\\mathrm { Z n } ( \\mathrm { s } )  \\mathrm { Z n } ^ { 2 + }$ (aq, $\\mathrm { ~ 1 ~ M ~ 1 ~ 2 ~ e ~ } ^ { - }$ \n\nRight electrode: ${ \\mathrm { C u } } ^ { 2 + }$ (aq, $1 \\ \\mathrm { M } ) + 2 \\ \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }  \\mathrm { C u ( s ) }$ \n\nThe overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions and we obtain the equation: \n\nSometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes. They do not participate in the reaction but provide their surface for oxidation or reduction reactions and for the conduction of electrons. For example, $\\mathrm { P t }$ is used in the following half-cells: \n\nHydrogen electrode: $\\mathrm { P t } ( \\mathrm { s } ) \\mid \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } ( \\mathrm { g } ) \\mid \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } ( \\mathrm { a q } )$ \n\nwith half-cell reaction: $\\mathrm { H ^ { + } ( a q ) + e ^ { - }  \\Omega ^ { \\downarrow } 2 \\ H _ { 2 } ( g ) }$ \n\nBromine electrode: $\\mathrm { P t ( s ) } | \\mathrm { B r } _ { 2 } ( \\mathrm { a q } ) | \\ \\mathrm { B r } ^ { - } ( \\mathrm { a q } )$ \n\nWith half-cell reaction: $\\mathrm { \\Omega ^ { 1 } / 2 \\ B r _ { 2 } ( a q ) + e ^ { - }  B r ^ { - } ( a q ) }$ \n\nThe standard electrode potentials are very important and we can extract a lot of useful information from them. The values of standard electrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are given in Table 2.1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode is greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to hydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative then hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species. It can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the highest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas $( \\mathrm { F _ { 2 } } )$ has the maximum tendency to get reduced to fluoride ions $( \\mathrm { F ^ { - } } )$ and therefore fluorine gas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest reducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating that lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is the most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be seen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2.1 the standard electrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising power of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of the species on the right hand side of the reaction. Electrochemical cells are extensively used for determining the pH of solutions, solubility product, equilibrium constant and other thermodynamic properties and for potentiometric titrations. - \n\nIntext Questions \n\n2.1 How would you determine the standard electrode potential of the system $\\mathbf { M g } ^ { 2 + } | \\mathbf { M g } ?$ (cid:) \n\n2.2 Can you store copper sulphate solutions in a zinc pot? \n\n2.3 Consult the table of standard electrode potentials and suggest three substances that can oxidise ferrous ions under suitable conditions. \n\n2.3 Nernst Equation \n\nwe have assumed in the previous section that the concentration of all the species involved in the electrode reaction is unity.

At the same time voltage of the cell as read on the voltmeter keeps on decreasing. After some time, we shall note that there is no change in the concentration of $\\mathrm { C u ^ { 2 + } }$ and $Z \\mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ ions and at the same time, voltmeter gives zero reading. This indicates that equilibrium has been attained. In this situation the Nernst equation may be written as: \n\nBut at equilibrium, \n\nand at $\\mathrm { T } = 2 9 8 \\mathrm { K }$ the above equation can be written as \n\nIn general, \n\nThus, Eq. (2.14) gives a relationship between equilibrium constant of the reaction and standard potential of the cell in which that reaction takes place.

If we want to obtain maximum work from a galvanic cell then charge has to be passed reversibly. The reversible work done by a galvanic cell is equal to decrease in its Gibbs energy and therefore, if the emf of the cell is $E$ and $n F$ is the amount of charge passed and $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { r } } G$ is the Gibbs energy of the reaction, then \n\nIt may be remembered that $E _ { \\mathrm { ( c e l l ) } }$ is an intensive parameter but $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { r } } G$ is an extensive thermodynamic property and the value depends on $n$ Thus, if we write the reaction - \n\nbut when we write the reaction \n\nIf the concentration of all the reacting species is unity, then (id \n\nThus, from the measurement of $E _ { \\mathrm { ( c e l l ) } } ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ we can obtain an important thermodynamic quantity, $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { r } } G ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ , standard Gibbs energy of the reaction.

Calculate the standard Gibbs energy and the equilibrium constant of the cell reaction. \n\nIt is necessary to define a few terms before we consider the subject of conductance of electricity through electrolytic solutions. The electrical resistance is represented by the symbol $\\mathbf { \\vec { \\nabla } } R \\mathbf { \\vec { \\mu } }$ and it is measured in ohm $\\left( \\Omega \\right)$ which in terms of SI base units is equal to $( \\mathrm { k g \\ m ^ { 2 } } ) / ( \\mathrm { S } ^ { 3 } \\ A ^ { 2 } )$ . It can be measured with the help of a wheatstone bridge with which you are familiar from your study of physics. The electrical resistance of any object is directly proportional to its length, l, and inversely proportional to its area of cross section, $A .$ That is, \n\nThe constant of proportionality, p (Greek, rho), is called resistivity (specific resistance). Its SI units are ohm metre $\\left( \\Omega \\mathrm { ~ m } \\right)$ and quite often its submultiple, ohm centimetre $\\left( \\Omega \\mathrm { c m } \\right)$ is also used. IUPAC recommends the use of the term resistivity over specific resistance and hence in the rest of the book we shall use the term resistivity. Physically, the resistivity for a substance is its resistance when it is one metre long and its area of cross section is one $\\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ . It can be seen that: \n\nThe inverse of resistance, $R _ { : }$ is called conductance, $G$ , and we have the relation: \n\nThe SI unit of conductance is siemens, represented by the symbol $\\mathbf { \\ddot { S } } ^ { \\prime }$ and is equal to $\\mathrm { { o h m } ^ { - 1 } }$ (also known as mho) or $\\boldsymbol { \\Omega } ^ { - 1 }$ . The inverse of resistivity, called conductivity (specific conductance) is represented by the symbol, $\\kappa$ (Greek, kappa). IUPAC has recommended the use of term conductivity over specific conductance and hence we shall use the term conductivity in the rest of the book. The SI units of conductivity are $\\mathrm { ~ \\mathsf ~ { ~ S ~ m ~ } ~ } ^ { - 1 }$ but quite often, $\\kappa$ is expressed in $\\mathrm { ~ S ~ c m ^ { - 1 } }$ . Conductivity of a material in $\\mathrm { S ~ m ^ { - 1 } }$ is its conductance when it is $1 \\textrm { m }$ long and its area of cross section is $1 ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ . It may be noted that $1 ~ { \\mathrm { S } } ~ { \\mathrm { c m } } ^ { - 1 } = ~ 1 0 0 ~ { \\mathrm { S } } ~ { \\mathrm { m } } ^ { - 1 }$ \n\nIt can be seen from Table 2.2 that the magnitude of conductivity varies a great deal and depends on the nature of the material. It also depends on the temperature and pressure at which the measurements are made. Materials are classified into conductors, insulators and semiconductors depending on the magnitude of their conductivity. Metals and their alloys have very large conductivity and are known as conductors. Certain non-metals like carbon-black, graphite and some organic polymers\\* are also electronically conducting. Substances like glass, ceramics, etc., having very low conductivity are known as insulators. Substances like silicon, doped silicon and gallium arsenide having conductivity between conductors and insulators are called semiconductors and are important electronic materials. Certain materials called superconductors by definition have zero resistivity or infinite conductivity. Earlier, only metals and their alloys at very low temperatures (0 to 15 K) were known to behave as superconductors, but nowadays a number of ceramic materials and mixed oxides are also known to show superconductivity at temperatures as high as 150 K. \n\nElectrical conductance through metals is called metallic or electronic conductance and is due to the movement of electrons. The electronic conductance depends on \n\n(i) the nature and structure of the metal (ii) the number of valence electrons per atom (ii) temperature (it decreases with increase of temperature). \n\nAs the electrons enter at one end and go out through the other end, the composition of the metallic conductor remains unchanged. The mechanism of conductance through semiconductors is more complex. \n\nWe already know that even very pure water has small amounts of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions $( { \\sim } 1 0 ^ { - 7 } \\mathrm { M } )$ which lend it very low conductivity $( \\mathrm { { 3 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \\mathrm { { S m ^ { - 1 } } } } } )$ ). when electrolytes are dissolved in water, they furnish their own ions in the solution hence its conductivity also increases. The conductance of electricity by ions present in the solutions is called electrolytic or ionic conductance. The conductivity of electrolytic (ionic) solutions depends on: \n\n(i) the nature of the electrolyte added   \n(ii) size of the ions produced and their solvation   \n(ii) the nature of the solvent and its viscosity   \n(iv) concentration of the electrolyte (v) temperature (it increases with the increase of temperature). \n\nPassage of direct current through ionic solution over a prolonged period can lead to change in its composition due to electrochemical reactions (Section 2.4.1). \n\n2.4.1 Measurement of the Conductivity of Ionic Solutions \n\nWe know that accurate measurement of an unknown resistance can be performed on a Wheatstone bridge. However, for measuring the resistance of an ionic solution we face two problems. Firstly, passing direct current (DC) changes the composition of the solution. Secondly, a solution cannot be connected to the bridge like a metallic wire or other solid conductor. The first difficulty is resolved by using an alternating current (AC) source of power. The second problem is solved by using a specially designed vessel called conductivity cell. It is available in several designs and two simple ones are shown in Fig. 2.4. \n\nBasically it consists of two platinum electrodes coated with platinum black (finely divided metallic $\\mathrm { P t }$ is deposited on the electrodes electrochemically). These have area of cross section equal to $\\cdot _ { A } ,$ and are separated by distance $\\mathbf { \\nabla } ^ { \\cdot } l ^ { \\prime }$ . Therefore, solution confined between these electrodes is a column of length $l$ and area of cross section $A$ .The resistance of such a column of solution is then given by the equation: \n\nThe quantity $l / A$ is called cell constant denoted by the symbol, $G ^ { * }$ . It depends on the distance between the electrodes and their area of cross-section and has the dimension of length-' and can be calculated if we know I and A. Measurement of $l$ and $A$ is not only inconvenient but also unreliable. The cell constant is usually determined by measuring the resistance of the cell containing a solution whose conductivity is already known. For this purpose, we generally use KCl solutions whose conductivity is known accurately at various concentrations (Table 2.3) and at different temperatures. The cell constant, $G ^ { * }$ , is then given by the equation: \n\nOnce the cell constant is determined, we can use it for measuring the resistance or conductivity of any solution. The set up for the measurement of the resistance is shown in Fig. 2.5. \n\nIt consists of two resistances $R _ { 3 }$ and $R _ { 4 }$ ,a variable resistance $R _ { 1 }$ and the conductivity cell having the unknown resistance $R _ { 2 }$ .The wheatstone bridge is fed by an oscillator $\\mathrm { o }$ (a source of a.c. power in the audio frequency range 550 to 5000 cycles per second). $\\mathrm { P }$ is a suitable detector (a headphone or other electronic device) and the bridge is balanced when no current passes through the detector. Under these conditions: \n\nUnknown resistance $R _ { 2 } = \\frac { { \\sf R } _ { 1 } { \\sf R } _ { 4 } } { { \\sf R } _ { 3 } }$ \n\nThese days, inexpensive conductivity meters are available which can directly read the conductance or resistance of the solution in the conductivity cell. Once the cell constant and the resistance of the solution in the cell is determined, the conductivity of the solution is given by the equation: \n\nThe conductivity of solutions of different electrolytes in the same solvent and at a given temperature differs due to charge and size of the ions in which they dissociate, the concentration of ions or ease with which the ions move under a potential gradient. It, therefore, becomes necessary to define a physically more meaningful quantity called molar conductivity denoted by the symbol $\\varLambda _ { m }$ (Greek, lambda). It is related to the conductivity of the solution by the equation: \n\nIn the above equation, if $\\kappa$ is expressed in $\\mathbf { S } \\mathbf { m } ^ { - 1 }$ and the concentration, c in $\\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 3 }$ then the units of $\\varLambda _ { m }$ are in $\\mathrm { { S m ^ { 2 } m o l ^ { - 1 } } }$ . It may be noted that: \n\n$1 \\ \\mathrm { m o l \\ m ^ { - 3 } } = \\mathrm { 1 0 0 0 } ( \\mathrm { L } / \\mathrm { m ^ { 3 } } ) \\ \\times$ molarity (mol/L), and hence \n\nIf we use $\\mathrm { ~ S ~ c m ^ { - 1 } }$ as the units for $\\kappa$ and mol $\\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ , the units of concentration, then the units for $\\Lambda _ { m }$ are $\\mathrm { S \\ c m ^ { 2 } m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ . It can be calculated by using the equation: \n\nBoth type of units are used in literature and are related to each other by the equations: ■ \n\nResistance of a conductivity cell filled with $0 . 1 \\mathrm { \\ m o l { L } ^ { - 1 } }$ KCl solution is $1 0 0 ~ \\Omega$ .

Conductivity always decreases with decrease in concentration both, for weak and strong electrolytes. This can be explained by the fact that the number of ions per unit volume that carry the current in a solution decreases on dilution. The conductivity of a solution at any given concentration is the conductance of one unit volume of solution kept between two platinum electrodes with unit area of cross section and at a distance of unit length. This is clear from the equation: \n\n$G = \\frac { \\kappa A } { l } = \\kappa$ = k (both A and l are unity in their appropriate units in 1 or cm) \n\nMolar conductivity of a solution at a given concentration is the conductance of the volume $V$ of solution containing one mole of electrolyte kept between two electrodes with area of cross section $A$ and distance of unit length. Therefore, \n\nSince $l = 1$ and $A = V$ ( volume containing 1 mole of electrolyte) \n\nMolar conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. This is because the total volume, $V ,$ of solution containing one mole of electrolyte also increases. It has been found that decrease in $\\kappa$ on dilution of a solution is more than compensated by increase in its volume. Physically, it means that at a given concentration, $\\Lambda _ { m }$ can be defined as the conductance of the electrolytic solution kept between the electrodes of a conductivity cell at unit distance but having area of cross section large enough to accommodate sufficient volume of solution that contains one mole of the electrolyte. when concentration approaches zero, the molar conductivity is known as limiting molar conductivity and is represented by the symbol $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ .The variation in $\\varLambda _ { m }$ with concentration is different (Fig. 2.6) for strong and weak electrolytes. \n\nStrong Electrolytes \n\nFor strong electrolytes, $\\boldsymbol { { \\Lambda } } _ { m }$ increases slowly with dilution and can be represented by the equation: \n\nIt can be seen that if we plot (Fig. 2.6) $\\varLambda _ { m }$ against $c ^ { 1 / 2 }$ obtain  stight  withintercept eq $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ equal to $\\cdot _ { - A } ,$ . The value of the constant $\\cdot _ { A } \\cdot \\mathbf { \\vec { \\tau } }$ for a given solvent and temperature depends on the type of electrolyte i.e., the charges on the cation and anion produced on the dissociation of the electrolyte in the solution. Thus, NaCl, $\\mathrm { C a C l } _ { 2 }$ , $\\mathrm { M g S O _ { 4 } }$ are known as 1-1, 2-1 and 2-2 electrolytes respectively. All electrolytes of a particular type have the same value for $\\cdot _ { A } \\cdot \\mathbf { \\vec { \\tau } }$ . \n\nThe molar conductivity of KCl solutions at different concentrations at 298 K are given below: \n\nShow that a plot between $\\varLambda _ { m }$ and $c ^ { 1 / 2 }$ is a straight line. Determine the values of $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ and A for KCl. \n\nSolution Taking the square root of concentration we obtain: \n\nA plot of $\\varLambda _ { m }$ ( y-axis) and $\\mathbf { c } ^ { 1 / 2 }$ (cd $x$ axis) is shown in (Fig. 3.7).   \nIt can be seen that it is nearly a straight line. From the intercept   \n(cid: $\\lbrace c ^ { 1 / 2 } = 0 \\rbrace$ , we find that $\\mathring { \\Lambda _ { m } } = ~ 1 5 0 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { S ~ c m } ^ { 2 } ~ \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ and $A ~ = - ~ { \\mathrm { s l o p e } } ~ = 8 7 . 4 6 ~ { \\mathrm { S \\ c m ^ { 2 } \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } / ( m o l / L ^ { - 1 } ) ^ { 1 / 2 } } } .$ \n\nKohlrausch examined $\\hat { { \\cal { A } } } _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ values for a number of strong electrolytes and observed certain regularities. He noted that the difference in $\\bar { \\bar { \\varLambda _ { m } } }$ of the electrolytes NaX and KX for any $_ \\textrm { x }$ is nearly constant. For example at 298 K: \n\nand similarly it was found that \n\nOn the basis of the above observations he enunciated Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions. The law states that limiting molar conductivity of an electrolyte can be represented as the sum of the individual contributions of the anion and cation of the electrolyte. Thus, $i f \\lambda _ { N a } ^ { ^ { \\circ } } { } ^ { + } a n d \\lambda _ { c l } ^ { ^ { \\circ } } { } ^ { - }$ ions respectively, then the limiting molar conductivity for sodium chloride is given by the equation: \n\nIn general, if an electrolyte on dissociation gives $\\ v { v } _ { + }$ cations and $\\mathrm { v _ { \\mathrm { - } } }$ anions then its limiting molar conductivity is given by: \n\nHere, $\\lambda _ { + } ^ { ^ { \\circ } }$ and $\\lambda _ { - } ^ { ^ { \\circ } }$ are the limiting molar conductivities of the cation and anion respectively. The values of $\\lambda ^ { ^ { \\circ } }$ for some cations and anions at 298 K are given in Table 2.4. \n\nWeak Electrolytes \n\nWeak electrolytes like acetic acid have lower degree of dissociation at higher concentrations and hence for such electrolytes, the change in $\\varLambda _ { m }$ with dilution is due to increase in the degree of dissociation and consequently the number of ions in total volume of solution that contains $1 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }$ of electrolyte. In such cases $\\varLambda _ { m }$ increases steeply (Fig. 2.6) on dilution, especially near lower concentrations. Therefore, $\\hat { { \\cal A } } _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ cannot be obtained by extrapolation of $\\varLambda _ { m }$ to zero concentration. At infinite dilution (i.e., concentration $c  z e r o ]$ electrolyte dissociates completely $\\scriptstyle ( \\alpha = 1 )$ , but at such low concentration the conductivity of the solution is so low that it cannot be measured accurately. Therefore, $\\hat { { \\cal A } } _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ for weak electrolytes is obtained by using Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions (Example 2.8). At any concentration $c$ if $\\alpha$ is the degree of dissociation then it can be approximated to the ratio of molar conductivity $\\varLambda _ { m }$ at the concentration c to limiting molar conductivity, $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { 0 }$ . Thus we have: \n\nBut we know that for a weak electrolyte like acetic acid (Class XI, Unit 7, \n\nApplications of Kohlrausch law \n\nUsing Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions, it is possible to calculate $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { 0 }$ for any electrolyte from the $\\lambda ^ { \\mathrm { { o } } }$ of individual ions. Moreover, for weak electrolytes like acetic acid it is possible to determine the value of its dissociation constant once we know the $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { 0 }$ and $\\varLambda _ { m }$ at a given concentration c. \n\nExample 2.7 Calculate $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { 0 }$ for $\\mathrm { C a C l } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { { M g S O _ { 4 } } }$ from the data given in Table 3.4. \n\nSolution We know from Kohlrausch law that \n\nExample 2.8 $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { 0 }$ for Nac1, HCl and NaAc are 126.4, 425.9 and 91.0 S $\\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ respectively. Calculate $\\boldsymbol { \\Lambda } ^ { \\flat }$ for HAc. \n\nSolution \n\nExample 2.9 The conductivity of $\\mathrm { 0 . 0 0 1 0 2 8 \\ m o l \\ L ^ { - 1 } }$ acetic acid is $4 . 9 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \\mathrm { S \\ c m ^ { - 1 } }$ . Calculate its dissociation constant if $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { 0 }$ for acetic acid is $3 9 0 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { S \\ c m ^ { 2 } \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ . \n\n2.7 why does the conductivity of a solution decrease with dilution? \n\n2.8 Suggest a way to determine the $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ value of water. \n\n2.9 The molar conductivity of $0 . 0 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m o l ~ L ^ { - 1 } }$ methanoic acid is $4 6 . 1 \\mathrm { S } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ . Calculate its degree of dissociation and dissociation constant. Given $\\lambda ^ { 0 } ( \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } )$ (cid:) $= 3 4 9 . 6 \\ \\mathrm { S \\ c m ^ { 2 } \\ n o l ^ { - 1 } }$ and $\\lambda ^ { 0 } ( \\mathrm { H C O O ^ { - } } ) = 5 4 . 6 \\mathrm { ~ S ~ c m ^ { 2 } ~ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ . \n\n2.5 Electrolytic Cells and Electrolysis \n\nIn an electrolytic cell external source of voltage is used to bring about a chemical reaction. The electrochemical processes are of great importance in the laboratory and the chemical industry. One of the simplest electrolytic cell consists of two copper strips dipping in an aqueous solution of copper sulphate. If a DC voltage is applied to the two electrodes, then $\\mathrm { C u } ^ { \\bar { 2 } + }$ ions discharge at the cathode (negatively charged) and the follwing reaction takes place: \n\nCopper metal is deposited on the cathode. At the anode, copper is converted into $\\mathrm { { C u } ^ { 2 + } }$ ions by the reaction: \n\nThus copper is dissolved (oxidised) at anode and deposited (reduced) at cathode. This is the basis for an industrial process in which impure copper is converted into copper of high purity. The impure copper is made an anode that dissolves on passing current and pure copper is deposited at the cathode. Many metals like Na, Mg, Al, etc. are produced on large scale by electrochemical reduction of their respective cations where no suitable chemical reducing agents are available for this purpose. \n\nSodium and magnesium metals are produced by the electrolysis of their fused chlorides and aluminium is produced by electrolysis of aluminium oxide in presence of cryolite. \n\nQuantitative Aspects of Electrolysis \n\nMichael Faraday was the first scientist who described the quantitative aspects of electrolysis. Now Faraday's laws also flow from what has been discussed earlier. \n\nFaraday's Laws of Electrolysis \n\nAfter his extensive investigations on electrolysis of solutions and melts of electrolytes, Faraday published his results during 1833-34 in the form of the following well known Faraday's two laws of electrolysis: \n\n(i) First Law: The amount of chemical reaction which occurs at any electrode during electrolysis by a current is proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte (solution or melt).   \n(ii) Second Law: The amounts of different substances liberated by the same quantity of electricity passing through the electrolytic solution are proportional to their chemical equivalent weights (Atomic Mass of Metal $\\div$ Number of electrons required to reduce the cation). \n\nThere were no constant current sources available during Faraday's times. The general practice was to put a coulometer (a standard electrolytic cell) for determining the quantity of electricity passed from the amount of metal (generally silver or copper) deposited or consumed. However, coulometers are now obsolete and we now have constant current $\\left( I \\right)$ sources available and the quantity of electricity $Q$ , passed is given by \n\n$Q$ is in coloumbs when $I$ is in ampere and $t$ is in second. \n\nThe amount of electricity (or charge) required for oxidation or reduction depends on the stoichiometry of the electrode reaction. For example, in the reaction: \n\nOne mole of the electron is required for the reduction of one mole of silver ions. ▲ \n\nWe know that charge on one electron is equal to $1 . 6 0 2 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 1 9 } \\mathrm { C }$ \n\nTherefore, the charge on one mole of electrons is equal to: \n\nThis quantity of electricity is called Faraday and is represented by the symbol $\\mathbf { F }$ \n\nFor approximate calculations we use $1 { \\mathrm { F } } \\simeq 9 6 5 0 0 { \\mathrm { ~ C ~ m o l } } ^ { - 1 } .$ \n\nFor the electrode reactions: \n\nIt is obvious that one mole of $\\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ and ${ \\mathbb { A } } ^ { 3 + }$ require $2 \\mathrm { m o l }$ of electrons (2F) and $3 \\mathrm { m o l }$ of electrons (3F) respectively. The charge passed through the electrolytic cell during electrolysis is equal to the product of current in amperes and time in seconds. In commercial production of metals, current as high as 5o,ooo amperes are used that amounts to about 0.518 $\\mathrm { F }$ per second. - \n\nExample 2.10 \n\nA solution of $\\mathrm { C u S O _ { 4 } }$ is electrolysed for 10 minutes with a current of 1.5 amperes. what is the mass of copper deposited at the cathode? $t = 6 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { : }$ s charge $=$ current $\\times$ time = 1.5 A × 600 s = 900 C According to the reaction:   \n$\\mathrm { C u } ^ { 2 + } ( \\mathrm { a q } ) + 2 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - } = \\mathrm { C u } ( \\mathrm { s } )$   \nwe require 2F or $2 \\times 9 6 4 8 7 \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ to deposit $1 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }$ or $6 3 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of Cu. For 9o0 C, the mass of Cu deposited   \n$= ( 6 3 ~ \\mathrm { g ~ m o l ^ { - 1 } ~ \\times ~ 9 0 0 ~ C } ) / ( 2 ~ \\times ~ 9 6 4 8 7 ~ \\mathrm { C ~ m o l ^ { - 1 } } ) ~ = ~ 0 . 2 9 3 8 ~ \\mathrm { g } .$ \n\n2.5.1 Products of Electrolysis \n\nProducts of electrolysis depend on the nature of material being electrolysed and the type of electrodes being used. If the electrode is inert (e.g., platinum or gold), it does not participate in the chemical reaction and acts only as source or sink for electrons. On the other hand, if the electrode is reactive, it participates in the electrode reaction. Thus, the products of electrolysis may be different for reactive and inert electrodes.The products of electrolysis depend on the different oxidising and reducing species present in the electrolytic cell and their standard electrode potentials. Moreover, some of the electrochemical processes although feasible, are so slow kinetically that at lower voltages these do not seem to take place and extra potential (called overpotential has to be applied, which makes such process more difficult to occur. \n\nFor example, if we use molten NaCl, the products of electrolysis are sodium metal and $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ gas. Here we have only one cation $\\boldsymbol { ( \\mathrm { N a ^ { + } ) } }$ which is reduced at the cathode $\\mathrm { ( N a ^ { + } + e ^ { - }  N a ) }$ and one anion (Cl) which is oxidised at the anode $\\mathrm { ( C l ^ { - }  ^ { 1 } 2 C l _ { 2 } + e ^ { - } }$ ). During the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride solution, the products are NaOH, $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ . In this case besides $\\mathrm { N a } ^ { + }$ and $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ ions we also have $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ and $\\mathrm { O H } ^ { - }$ ions along with the solvent molecules, $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ . \n\nAt the cathode there is competition between the following reduction reactions: \n\nThe reaction with higher value of $E ^ { \\scriptscriptstyle 0 }$ is preferred and therefore, the reaction at the cathode during electrolysis is: \n\nbut $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ (aq) is produced by the dissociation of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ i.e., \n\nTherefore, the net reaction at the cathode may be written as the sum of (2.33) and (2.34) and we have \n\nAt the anode the following oxidation reactions are possible: \n\nThe reaction at anode with lower value of $E ^ { \\circ }$ is preferred and therefore, water should get oxidised in preference to $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ (aq). However, on account of overpotential of oxygen, reaction (2.36) is preferred. Thus, the net reactions may be summarised as: \n\n$\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\mathrm { N a C l ~ ( a q ) ~ } \\xrightarrow { \\mathrm { H _ 2 O } } \\mathrm { ~ N a ~ } ^ { + } \\mathrm { ( a q ) ~ } + \\mathrm { C l } ^ { - } \\mathrm { ~ ( a q ) } } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { C a t h o d e } \\mathrm { : } \\qquad \\mathrm { H _ 2 O } \\mathrm { ( \\it l ) } + \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }  \\mathrm { \\it / { 2 } } \\mathrm { ~ H _ 2 ( \\mathrm { g } ) ~ } + \\mathrm { O H } ^ { - } \\mathrm { ~ ( a q ) } } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { A n o d e } \\mathrm { : } \\qquad \\mathrm { C l } ^ { - } \\mathrm { ~ ( a q ) }  \\mathrm { \\it / { 2 } ~ C l _ 2 ( \\mathrm { g } ) ~ } + \\mathrm { ~ e } ^ { - } } \\end{array}$ Net reaction: $\\mathrm { { N a C l } ( a q ) + H _ { 2 } O ( \\mathit { l } ) \\to \\mathrm { N a } ^ { + } ( a q ) + O H ^ { - } ( a q ) + ^ { 1 } / 2 H _ { 2 } ( g ) + ^ { 1 } / 2 C l _ { 2 } ( g ) }$ \n\nThe standard electrode potentials are replaced by electrode potentials given by Nernst equation (Eq. 2.8) to take into account the concentration effects. During the electrolysis of sulphuric acid, the following processes are possible at the anode: \n\nFor dilute sulphuric acid, reaction (2.38) is preferred but at higher concentrations of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ , reaction (2.39) is preferred. \n\nIntext Questions \n\n2.10 If a current of 0.5 ampere flows through a metallic wire for 2 hours, then how many electrons would flow through the wire? \n\n2.11 Suggest a list of metals that are extracted electrolytically. \n\n2.12 Consider the reaction: $\\mathrm { C r _ { 2 } O _ { 7 } } ^ { 2 - } + 1 4 \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } + 6 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }  2 \\mathrm { C r } ^ { 3 + } + 7 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ \n\nwhat is the quantity of electricity in coulombs needed to reduce 1 mol of $\\mathrm { C r } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 7 } { } ^ { 2 - } ?$ (cid:) \n\n2.6 Batteries \n\nAny battery (actually it may have one or more than one cell connected in series) or cell that we use as a source of electrical energy is basically a galvanic cell where the chemical energy of the redox reaction is converted into electrical energy. However, for a battery to be of practical use it should be reasonably light, compact and its voltage should not vary appreciably during its use. There are mainly two types of batteries. \n\n2.6.1 Primary Batteries \n\nCarbon rod (cathode) \n\nIn the primary batteries, the reaction occurs only once and after use   \nover a period of time battery becomes dead and cannot be reused again. The most familiar example of this type is the dry cell (known as Leclanche cell after its discoverer) which is used commonly in our transistors and clocks. The cell consists of a zinc container that also acts as anode and the cathode is a carbon (graphite) rod surrounded by powdered manganese dioxide and carbon (Fig.2.8). The space between the electrodes is filled by a moist paste of ammonium chloride $\\mathrm { ( N H } _ { 4 } \\mathrm { C l ) }$ and zinc chloride $\\mathrm { ( Z n C l _ { 2 } ) }$ .The electrode reactions are complex, but they can be written approximately as follows : \n\nAnode: $\\mathrm { Z n ( s ) \\longrightarrow Z n ^ { 2 + } + 2 e ^ { - } }$ \n\nCathode: $\\mathrm { M n O _ { 2 } ^ { + } \\Delta N H _ { 4 } ^ { + } { } ^ { + } \\ e ^ { - } \\longrightarrow M n O ( O H ) + N H _ { 3 } }$ \n\nIn the reaction at cathode, manganese is reduced from the $^ \\mathrm { ~ + ~ 4 ~ }$ oxidation state to the $+ 3$ state. Ammonia produced in the reaction forms a complex with $Z \\mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ to give $\\mathrm { [ Z n \\ ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 + } }$ . The cell has a potential of nearly $1 . 5 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ (i \n\nMercury cell, (Fig. 2.9) suitable for low current devices like hearing aids, watches, etc. consists of zinc – mercury amalgam as anode and a paste of $\\mathrm { H g O }$ and carbon as the cathode. The electrolyte is a paste of KOH and $Z \\mathrm { n O }$ . The electrode reactions for the cell are given below: \n\nAnode: $Z n ( H \\mathrm { g } ) + 2 \\mathrm { O H } ^ { - } \\longrightarrow \\mathrm { Z n O ( s ) } + \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } + 2 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }$ Cathode: (cid:) $\\mathrm { H g O } + \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } + 2 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - } \\longrightarrow \\mathrm { H g ( l ) } + 2 \\mathrm { O H } ^ { - }$ \n\n2.6.2 Secondary Batteries \n\nThe overall reaction is represented by \n\nThe cell potential is approximately $1 . 3 5 \\mathrm { V }$ and remains constant during its life as the overall reaction does not involve any ion in solution whose concentration can change during its life time. \n\nA secondary cell after use can be recharged by passing current through it in the opposite direction so that it can be used again. A good secondary cell can undergo a large number of discharging and charging cycles. The most important secondary cell is the lead storage battery (Fig. 2.10) commonly used in automobiles and invertors. It consists of a lead anode and a grid of lead packed with lead dioxide $\\mathrm { ( P b O _ { 2 } }$ ) as cathode. A $3 8 \\%$ solution of sulphuric acid is used as an electrolyte. \n\nThe cell reactions when the battery is in use are given below: \n\nAnode: $\\mathrm { P b } ( \\mathrm { s } ) + \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } ^ { 2 - } ( \\mathrm { a q } )  \\mathrm { P b } \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } ( \\mathrm { s } ) + 2 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }$ \n\n.e., overall cell reaction consisting of cathode and anode reactions is: \n\nOn charging the battery the reaction is reversed and $\\mathrm { P b S O _ { 4 } ( s ) }$ on anode and cathode is converted into $\\mathrm { P b }$ and $\\mathrm { P b } { \\cal O } _ { 2 }$ , respectively. \n\nAnother important secondary cell is the nickel-cadmium cell (Fig. 2.1 1) which has longer life than the lead storage cell but more expensive to manufacture. We shall not go into details of working of the cell and the electrode reactions during charging and discharging. The overall reaction during discharge is: \n\n2.7 fuel Cells \n\nProduction of electricity by thermal plants is not a very efficient method and is a major source of pollution. In such plants, the chemical energy (heat of combustion) of fossil fuels (coal, gas or oil) is first used for converting water into high pressure steam. This is then used to run a turbine to produce electricity. We know that a galvanic cell directly converts chemical energy into electricity and is highly efficient. It is now possible to make such cells in which reactants are fed continuously to the electrodes and products are removed continuously from the electrolyte compartment. Galvanic cells that are designed to convert the energy of combustion of fuels like hydrogen, methane, methanol, etc. directly into electrical energy are called fuel cells. \n\nOne of the most successful fuel cells uses the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to form water (Fig. 2.12). The cell was used for providing electrical power in the Apollo space programme. The water vapours produced during the reaction were condensed and added to the drinking water supply for the astronauts. In the cell, hydrogen and oxygen are bubbled through porous carbon electrodes into concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. Catalysts like finely divided platinum or palladium metal are incorporated into the electrodes for increasing the rate of electrode reactions. The electrode reactions are \n\ngiven below: \n\nOverall reaction being: $\\mathrm { 2 H _ { 2 } ( g ) + O _ { 2 } ( g ) \\longrightarrow 2 H _ { 2 } O ( l ) }$ \n\nThe cell runs continuously as long as the reactants are supplied. Fuel cells produce electricity with an efficiency of about $7 0 \\%$ compared to thermal plants whose efficiency is about $4 0 \\%$ . There has been tremendous progress in the development of new electrode materials, better catalysts and electrolytes for increasing the efficiency of fuel cells. These have been used in automobiles on an experimental basis. Fuel cells are pollution free and in view of their future importance, a variety of fuel cells have been fabricated and tried. \n\nOxidation: Fe $( \\mathbf { s } ) $ (cid:) $\\mathrm { F e ^ { 2 + } }$ (aq) $+ 2 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }$   \nReduction: $\\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } ( \\mathrm { g } ) + 4 \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } ( \\mathrm { a q } ) + 4 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }  2 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } ( \\mathrm { l } )$   \nAtomospheric   \noxidation: $2 \\mathrm { F e ^ { 2 + } ( a q ) } + 2 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O ( l ) } + \\mathrm { \\downarrow } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { ( g ) }  \\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { ( s ) } + \\mathrm { 4 H ^ { + } ( a q ) }$ \n\nCorrosion slowly coats the surfaces of metallic objects with oxides or other salts of the metal. The rusting of iron, tarnishing of silver, development of green coating on copper and bronze are some of the examples of corrosion. It causes enormous damage to buildings, bridges, ships and to all objects made of metals especially that of iron. We lose crores of rupees every year on account of corrosion. \n\nIn corrosion, a metal is oxidised by loss of electrons to oxygen and formation of oxides. Corrosion of iron (commonly known as rusting) occurs in presence of water and air. The chemistry of corrosion is quite complex but it may be considered essentially as an electrochemical phenomenon. At a particular spot (Fig. 2.13) of an object made of iron, oxidation takes place and that spot behaves as anode and we can write the reaction \n\nElectrons released at anodic spot move through the metal and go to another spot on the metal and reduce oxygen in the presence of $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ (which is believed to be available from $\\mathrm { { H _ { 2 } C O _ { 3 } } }$ formed due to dissolution of carbon dioxide from air into water. Hydrogen ion in water may also be available due to dissolution of other acidic oxides from the atmosphere). This spot behaves as cathode with the reaction \n\nThe overall reaction being: \n\nThe ferrous ions are further oxidised by atmospheric oxygen to ferric ions which come out as rust in the form of hydrated ferric oxide $( \\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 } . \\ x \\ \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } )$ and with further production of hydrogen ions. \n\nPrevention of corrosion is of prime importance. It not only saves money but also helps in preventing accidents such as a bridge collapse or failure of a key component due to corrosion. One of the simplest methods of preventing corrosion is to prevent the surface of the metallic object to come in contact with atmosphere. This can be done by covering the surface with paint or by some chemicals (e.g. bisphenol). Another simple method is to cover the surface by other metals (Sn, Zn, etc.) that are inert or react to save the object. An electrochemical method is to provide a sacrificial electrode of another metal (like Mg, Zn, etc.) which corrodes itself but saves the object. \n\nIntext Questions \n\n2.13 Write the chemistry of recharging the lead storage battery, highlighting all the materials that are involved during recharging. \n\n2.14 Suggest two materials other than hydrogen that can be used as fuels in fuel cells. \n\n2.15 Explain how rusting of iron is envisaged as setting up of an electrochemical cell. \n\nThe Hydrogen Economy \n\nAt present the main source of energy that is driving our economy is fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. As more people on the planet aspire to improve their standard of living, their energy requirement will increase. In fact, the per capita consumption of energy used is a measure of development. Of course, it is assumed that energy is used for productive purpose and not merely wasted. We are already aware that carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil fuels is resulting in the 'Greenhouse Effect'. This is leading to a rise in the temperature of the Earth's surface, causing polar ice to melt and ocean levels to rise. This will flood low-lying areas along the coast and some island nations such as Maldives face total submergence. In order to avoid such a catastrope, we need to limit our use of carbonaceous fuels. Hydrogen provides an ideal alternative as its combustion results in water only. Hydrogen production must come from splitting water using solar energy. Therefore, hydrogen can be used as a renewable and non polluting source of energy. This is the vision of the Hydrogen Economy. Both the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water and hydrogen combustion in a fuel cell will be important in the future. And both these technologies are based on electrochemical principles. \n\nSummary \n\nAn electrochemical cell consists of two metalic electrodes dipping in electrolytic solution(s). Thus an important component of the electrochemical cell is the ionic conductor or electrolyte. Electrochemical cells are of two types. In galvanic cell, the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical work, whereas in an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to carry out a nonspontaneous redox reaction. The standard electrode potential for any electrode dipping in an appropriate solution is defined with respect to standard electrode potential of hydrogen electrode taken as zero. The standard potential of the cell an $\\ : [ \\ : E _ { \\mathrm { ( c e l l ) } } ^ { \\mathrm { o } } \\ : = \\ : E ^ { \\mathrm { o } } \\ :$ catie $E ^ { 0 }$ related to standard Gibbs energy $( \\Delta _ { r } G ^ { \\mathrm { o } } ~ = ~ - n F E _ { \\mathrm { ( c e l l ) } } ^ { \\mathrm { o } } )$ and equilibrium constant $( \\Delta _ { r } G ^ { \\mathrm { o } } = - \\ R T \\ln \\ K )$ of the reaction taking place in the cell. Concentration dependence of the potentials of the electrodes and the cells are given by Nernst equation. \n\nThe conductivity, $\\kappa ,$ of an electrolytic solution depends on the concentration of the electrolyte, nature of solvent and temperature. Molar conductivity, $\\varLambda _ { m }$ ,is defined by $\\quad = \\ \\kappa / c$ where $c$ is the concentration. Conductivity decreases but molar conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. It increases slowly with decrease in concentration for strong electrolytes while the increase is very steep for weak electrolytes in very dilute solutions. Kohlrausch found that molar conductivity at infinite dilution, for an electrolyte is sum of the contribution of the molar conductivity of the ions in which it dissociates. It is known as law of independent migration of ions and has many applications. Ions conduct electricity through the solution but oxidation and reduction of the ions take place at the electrodes in an electrochemical cell. Batteries and fuel cells are very useful forms of galvanic cell. Corrosion of metals is essentially an electrochemical phenomenon. Electrochemical principles are relevant to the Hydrogen Economy. \n\n2.1 Arrange the following metals in the order in which they displace each other from the solution of their salts.

    "content": "Objectives \n\nAfter studying this Unit, you will be able to \n\ndefine the average and instantaneous rate of a reaction; express the rate of a reaction in terms of change in concentration of either of the reactants or products with time; ● distinguish between elementary and complex reactions; ● differentiate between the molecularity and order of a reaction; define rate constant; ● discuss the dependence of rate of reactions on concentration, temperature and catalyst; derive integrated rate equations for the zero and first order reactions; ● determine the rate constants for zeroth and first order reactions; ● describe collision theory. \n\nChemical Kinetics helps us to understand how chemical reactions occur. \n\nChemistry, by its very nature, is concerned with change. Substances with well defined properties are converted by chemical reactions into other substances with different properties. For any chemical reaction, chemists try to find out - \n\n(a) the feasibility of a chemical reaction which can be predicted by thermodynamics ( as you know that a reaction with $\\Delta \\mathrm { G } < 0$ , at constant temperature and pressure is feasible);   \n(b) extent to which a reaction will proceed can be determined from chemical equilibrium;   \n(c) speed of a reaction i.e. time taken by a reaction to reach equilibrium. \n\nAlong with feasibility and extent, it is equally important to know the rate and the factors controlling the rate of a chemical reaction for its complete understanding. For example, which parameters determine as to how rapidly food gets spoiled? How to design a rapidly setting material for dental filling? Or what controls the rate at which fuel burns in an auto engine? All these questions can be answered by the branch of chemistry, which deals with the study of reaction rates and their mechanisms, called chemical kinetics. The word kinetics is derived from the Greek word kinesis' meaning movement. Thermodynamics tells only about the feasibility of a reaction whereas chemical kinetics tells about the rate of a reaction. For example, thermodynamic data indicate that diamond shall convert to graphite but in reality the conversion rate is so slow that the change is not perceptible at all. Therefore, most people think that diamond is forever. Kinetic studies not only help us to determine the speed or rate of a chemical reaction but also describe the conditions by which the reaction rates can be altered. The factors such as concentration, temperature, pressure and catalyst affect the rate of a reaction. At the macroscopic level, we are interested in amounts reacted or formed and the rates of their consumption or formation. At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving orientation and energy of molecules undergoing collisions, are discussed. \n\nIn this Unit, we shall be dealing with average and instantaneous rate of reaction and the factors affecting these. Some elementary ideas about the collision theory of reaction rates are also given. However, in order to understand all these, let us first learn about the reaction rate. \n\nSome reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example, precipitation of silver chloride occurs instantaneously by mixing of aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride, On the other hand, some reactions are very slow, for example, rusting of iron in the presence of air and moisture. Also there are reactions like inversion of cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate speed. Can you think of more examples from each category? \n\nYou must be knowing that speed of an automobile is expressed in terms of change in the position or distance covered by it in a certain period of time. Similarly, the speed of a reaction or the rate of a reaction can be defined as the change in concentration of a reactant or product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in terms of: \n\n(i) the rate of decrease in concentration of any one of the reactants, or   \n(ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products. Consider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the   \nsystem remains constant. \n\nOne mole of the reactant $\\mathrm { R }$ produces one mole of the product P. If $[ \\mathrm { R } ] _ { 1 }$ and $[ \\mathrm { P l } _ { 1 }$ are the concentrations of R and $\\mathrm { P }$ respectively at time $\\mathbf { t } _ { 1 }$ and $\\left[ \\operatorname { R } \\right] _ { 2 }$ and $[ \\mathrm { P l } _ { 2 }$ are their concentrations at time $\\mathrm { t } _ { 2 }$ then, \n\nThe square brackets in the above expressions are used to express molar concentration. \n\nRate of disappearance of R \n\nRate of appearance of P \n\nSince, $\\Delta [ \\mathrm { R } ]$ is a negative quantity (as concentration of reactants is decreasing), it is multiplied with $^ { - 1 }$ to make the rate of the reaction a positive quantity. \n\nEquations (3. 1) and (3.2) given above represent the average rate of a reaction, Tav. \n\nAverage rate depends upon the change in concentration of reactants or products and the time taken for that change to occur (Fig. 3.1). \n\nUnits of rate of a reaction \n\nFrom equations (3.1) and (3.2), it is clear that units of rate are concentration $\\mathrm { t i m e ^ { - 1 } }$ . For example, if concentration is in $\\mathrm { m o l ~ L ^ { - 1 } }$ and time is in seconds then the units will be mol $\\mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 } \\mathbf { S } ^ { - 1 }$ . However, in gaseous reactions, when the concentration of gases is expressed in terms of their partial pressures, then the units of the rate equation will be atm $\\mathbf { S } ^ { - 1 }$ . \n\nFrom the concentrations of $\\mathrm { C _ { 4 } H _ { 9 } C l }$ (butyl chloride) at different times given Example 3.1 below, calculate the average rate of the reaction: \n\nduring different intervals of time. \n\nWe can determine the difference in concentration over different intervals Solution of time and thus determine the average rate by dividing $\\Delta [ \\mathrm { R } ]$ by $\\Delta t$ (Table 3. 1). \n\nIt can be seen (Table 3. 1) that the average rate falls from $1 . 9 0 \\times 0 ^ { - 4 } \\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 } \\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ to $0 . 4 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 } \\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ . However, average rate cannot be used to predict the rate of a reaction at a particular instant as it would be constant for the time interval for which it is calculated. So, to express the rate at a particular moment of time we determine the instantaneous rate. It is obtained when we consider the average rate at the smallest time interval say $\\mathrm { d } t$ (i.e. when $\\Delta t$ approaches zero). Hence, mathematically for an infinitesimally small dt instantaneous rate is given by \n\nIt can be determined graphically by drawing a tangent at time t on either of the curves for concentration of R and P vs time t and calculating its slope (Fig. 3.1). So in problem 3.1, $r _ { \\mathrm { i n s t } }$ at 600s for example, can be calculated by plotting concentration of butyl chloride as a function of time. A tangent is drawn that touches the curve at $t = 6 0 0 \\mathrm { s }$ (Fig. 3.2). \n\nThe slope of this tangent gives the instantaneous rate. \n\nNow consider a reaction \n\nwhere stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants and products are same, then rate of the reaction is given as \n\ni.e., rate of disappearance of any of the reactants is same as the rate of appearance of the products. But in the following reaction, two moles of H decompose to produce one mole each of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ a $\\mathrm { I } _ { 2 }$ (id: \n\nFor expressing the rate of such a reaction where stoichiometric coeficients of reactants or products are not equal to one, rate of disappearance of any of the reactants or the rate of appearance of products is divided by their respective stoichiometric coefficients. Since rate of consumption of HI is twice the rate of formation of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ or $\\mathrm { I } _ { 2 }$ ,to make them equal, the term $\\Delta [ \\mathrm { H I } ]$ is divided by 2. The rate of this reaction is given by \n\nRate of reaction $= - { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } { \\frac { \\Delta \\left[ \\mathrm { H I } \\right] } { \\Delta t } } = { \\frac { \\Delta \\left[ \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\right] } { \\Delta t } } = { \\frac { \\Delta \\left[ \\mathrm { I } _ { 2 } \\right] } { \\Delta t } }$ \n\nSimilarly, for the reaction \n\nFor a gaseous reaction at constant temperature, concentration is directly proportional to the partial pressure of a species and hence, rate can also be expressed as rate of change in partial pressure of the reactant or the product. \n\nExample 3.2 The decomposition of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 }$ in $\\mathrm { C C l } _ { 4 }$ at 318K has been studied by monitoring the concentration of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 }$ in the solution. Initially the concentration of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 }$ is $2 . 3 3 \\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 }$ and after 184 minutes, it is reduced to $2 . 0 8 \\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 }$ . The reaction takes place according to the equation \n\nCalculate the average rate of this reaction in terms of hours, minutes and seconds. what is the rate of production of $\\mathrm { N O } _ { 2 }$ during this period? \n\nSolution \n\nIt may be remembered that \n\nIntext Questions \n\n3.1 For the reaction $\\mathrm { R }  \\mathrm { P } .$ the concentration of a reactant changes from O.03M to 0.02M in 25 minutes. Calculate the average rate of reaction using units of time both in minutes and seconds. \n\n3.2 In a reaction, $2 \\mathrm { A } $ Products, the concentration of A decreases from 0.5 mol $\\mathrm { ~ L ~ } ^ { - 1 }$ to $0 . 4 \\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 }$ in 10 minutes. Calculate the rate during this interval? \n\n3.2 factors Influencing Rate of a Reaction \n\nRate of reaction depends upon the experimental conditions such as concentration of reactants (pressure in case of gases), temperature and catalyst. \n\n3.2.1 Dependence of Rate on Concentration \n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction at a given temperature may depend on the concentration of one or more reactants and products. The representation of rate of reaction in terms of concentration of the reactants is known as rate law. It is also called as rate equation or rate expression. \n\n3.2.2 Rate Expression and Rate Constant \n\nThe results in Table 3.1 clearly show that rate of a reaction decreases with the passage of time as the concentration of reactants decrease. Conversely, rates generally increase when reactant concentrations increase. So, rate of a reaction depends upon the concentration of reactants. \n\nConsider a general reaction \n\nwhere a, b, c and d are the stoichiometric coefficients of reactants and products. \n\nThe rate expression for this reaction is \n\nRate $\\propto [ \\mathrm { A } ] ^ { \\mathrm { x } } [ \\mathrm { B } ] ^ { \\mathrm { y } }$ \n\nwhere exponents $\\mathbf { x }$ and y may or may not be equal to the stoichiometric coefficients (a and b) of the reactants. Above equation can also be written as \n\nThis form of equation $_ { ( 3 . 4 \\mathrm { ~ b ~ } ) }$ is known as differential rate equation, where $k$ is a proportionality constant called rate constant. The equation like (3.4), which relates the rate of a reaction to concentration of reactants is called rate law or rate expression. Thus, rate law is the expression in which reaction rate is given in terms of molar concentration of reactants with each term raised to some power, which may or may not be same as the stoichiometric coefficient of the reacting species in a balanced chemical equation. For example: - \n\nWe can measure the rate of this reaction as a function of initial concentrations either by keeping the concentration of one of the reactants constant and changing the concentration of the other reactant or by changing the concentration of both the reactants. The following results are obtained (Table 3.2). \n\nIt is obvious, after looking at the results, that when the concentration of NO is doubled and that of $\\mathrm { { O } } _ { 2 }$ is kept constant then the initial rate increases by a factor of four from O.096 to $0 . 3 8 4 \\ : \\mathrm { \\ m o l \\ : \\ L ^ { - 1 } s ^ { - 1 } }$ .This indicates that the rate depends upon the square of the concentration of NO. when concentration of NO is kept constant and concentration of $\\mathrm { { O } } _ { 2 }$ is doubled the rate also gets doubled indicating that rate depends on concentration of $\\mathrm { { O } } _ { 2 }$ to the first power. Hence, the rate equation for this reaction will be \n\nThe differential form of this rate expression is given as \n\nNow, we observe that for this reaction in the rate equation derived from the experimental data, the exponents of the concentration terms are the same as their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation. \n\nSome other examples are given below: \n\nReaction Experimental rate expression 1 $\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\mathrm { , ~ C H C l _ 3 + C l _ 2  ~ C C l _ 4 + ~ H C l } } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C O O C _ { 2 } H _ { 5 } + H _ { 2 } O  \\mathrm { ~ C H _ 3 C O O H + C _ 2 H _ { 5 } O H } ~ R a t e } = k [ \\mathrm { C H C l _ 3 } ] ~ [ \\mathrm { C l _ 2 } ] ^ { 1 / 2 } } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { ~ C H _ 3 C O O C _ { 2 } H _ 5 + H _ 2 O  \\mathrm { ~ C H _ 3 ( C O O H + C _ 2 H _ 5  O H } ~ R a t e } = k [ \\mathrm { C H _ 3 } \\mathrm { C O O C _ { 2 } H _ 5 } ] ^ { 1 } [ \\mathrm { H _ 2 O } ] ^ { 0 } } \\end{array}$ 2 \n\nIn these reactions, the exponents of the concentration terms are not the same as their stoichiometric coefficients. Thus, we can say that: \n\nRate law for any reaction cannot be predicted by merely looking at the balanced chemical equation, i.e., theoretically but must be determined experimentally. \n\n3.2.3 Order of a Reaction \n\nIn the rate equation (3.4) \n\nRate $\\mathit { \\Theta } = \\mathit { \\Pi } _ { k }$ [A]×[B]y\n\nx and y indicate how sensitive the rate is to the change in concentration of A and B. Sum of these exponents, i.e., $\\mathbf x + \\mathbf y$ in (3.4) gives the overall order of a reaction whereas x and y represent the order with respect to the reactants A and B respectively. \n\nHence, the sum of powers of the concentration of the reactants in the rate law expression is called the order of that chemical reaction. \n\nOrder of a reaction can be 0, 1, 2, 3 and even a fraction. A zero order reaction means that the rate of reaction is independent of the concentration of reactants. \n\nExcample 3..3 \n\nCalculate the overall order of a reaction which has the rate expression \n\nSolution \n\n(a) Rate $= k \\ [ \\mathrm { A } ] ^ { 1 / 2 } \\ [ \\mathrm { B } ] ^ { 3 / 2 }$   \n(b) Rate $= k \\left[ \\mathrm { A } \\right] ^ { 3 / 2 } \\left[ \\mathrm { B } \\right] ^ { - 1 }$   \n(a) ${ \\mathrm { R a t e } } = k \\ { \\mathrm { [ A ] ^ { x } \\ [ B ] ^ { y } } }$ order $\\mathbf { \\Sigma } = \\mathbf { \\Sigma } \\mathbf { X } \\mathbf { \\Sigma } + \\mathbf { \\Sigma } \\mathbf { y }$ So order $= 1 / 2 + 3 / 2 = 2$ , i.e., second order   \n(b) order $= 3 / 2 + ( - 1 ) = 1 / 2$ , i.e., half order. \n\nA balanced chemical equation never gives us a true picture of how a reaction takes place since rarely a reaction gets completed in one step. The reactions taking place in one step are called elementary reactions. When a sequence of elementary reactions (called mechanism) gives us the products, the reactions are called complex reactions. \n\nThese may be consecutive reactions (e.g., oxidation of ethane to $\\mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$ and $_ \\mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ passes through a series of intermediate steps in which alcohol, aldehyde and acid are formed), reverse reactions and side reactions (e.g., nitration of phenol yields $o$ -nitrophenol and $p$ -nitrophenol). \n\nUnits of rate constant   \nFor a general reaction $\\begin{array} { l } { \\mathrm { a A + b B  c C + d D } } \\\\ { \\mathrm { R a t e } = k [ \\mathrm { A } ] ^ { \\mathrm { x } } [ \\mathrm { B } ] ^ { \\mathrm { y } } } \\end{array}$ Where $\\mathbf { x } + \\mathbf { y } = \\mathbf { n } =$ order of the reaction Rate k = [A][B]y concentration × time (concentration)\" 1 (where [A]=[B]) \n\nTaking SI units of concentration, $\\mathrm { { m o l ~ L ^ { - 1 } } }$ and time, s, the units of $k$ for different reaction order are listed in Table 3.3 \n\ndentify the reaction order from each of the following rate constants. \n\nExample 3.4 \n\n(i) $k = 2 . 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \\mathrm { ~ L ~ m o l ^ { - 1 } ~ s ^ { - 1 } }$ (i) $k = 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \\mathrm { ~ s } ^ { - 1 }$ (cid:) \n\n(i) The unit of second order rate constant is $\\mathrm { { L } \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } \\ s ^ { - 1 } }$ ,therefore Solution (cid:) $k = 2 . 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \\mathrm { ~ L ~ m o l ^ { - 1 } ~ s ^ { - 1 } }$ represents a second order reaction. \n\n(ii) The unit of a first order rate constant is $\\mathbf { S } ^ { - 1 }$ therefore (cid:) $k = 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \\mathrm { ~ s ^ { - 1 } }$ represents a first order reaction. \n\n3.2.4 Molecularity of a Reaction \n\nAnother property of a reaction called molecularity helps in understanding its mechanism. The number of reacting species (atoms, ions or molecules) taking part in an elementary reaction, which must collide simultaneously in order to bring about a chemical reaction is called molecularity of a reaction. The reaction can be unimolecular when one reacting species is involved, for example, decomposition of ammonium nitrite. \n\nBimolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between two species, for example, dissociation of hydrogen iodide. \n\nTrimolecular or termolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between three reacting species, for example, \n\nThe probability that more than three molecules can collide and react simultaneously is very small. Hence, reactions with the molecularity three are very rare and slow to proceed. \n\nIt is, therefore, evident that complex reactions involving more than three molecules in the stoichiometric equation must take place in more than one step. \n\nThis reaction which apparently seems to be of tenth order is actually a second order reaction. This shows that this reaction takes place in several steps. which step controls the rate of the overall reaction? The question can be answered if we go through the mechanism of reaction, for example, chances to win the relay race competition by a team depend upon the slowest person in the team. Similarly, the overall rate of the reaction is controlled by the slowest step in a reaction called the rate determining step. Consider the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide which is catalysed by iodide ion in an alkaline medium. \n\nThe rate equation for this reaction is found to be \n\nThis reaction is first order with respect to both $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ and $\\Gamma$ . Evidences suggest that this reaction takes place in two steps \n\nBoth the steps are bimolecular elementary reactions. Species IO' is called as an intermediate since it is formed during the course of the reaction but not in the overall balanced equation. The first step, being slow, is the rate determining step. Thus, the rate of formation of intermediate will determine the rate of this reaction. \n\nThus, from the discussion, til now, we conclude the following: \n\n(i) Order of a reaction is an experimental quantity. It can be zero and even a fraction but molecularity cannot be zero or a non integer.   \n(ii) Order is applicable to elementary as well as complex reactions whereas molecularity is applicable only for elementary reactions. For complex reaction molecularity has no meaning. \n\n(ii) For complex reaction, order is given by the slowest step and molecularity of the slowest step is same as the order of the overall reaction. \n\nIntext Questions \n\n3.3 For a reaction, $\\mathrm { A } + \\mathrm { B } $ Product; the rate law is given by, $r = k [ \\mathrm { A } ] ^ { 1 / 2 } [ \\mathrm { B } ] ^ { 2 }$ What is the order of the reaction? \n\n3.4 The conversion of molecules $_ \\textrm { x }$ to $\\mathrm { Y }$ follows second order kinetics. If concentration of X is increased to three times how will it affect the rate of formation of Y? \n\n3.3 Integrated Rate Equations \n\nWe have already noted that the concentration dependence of rate is called differential rate equation. It is not always convenient to determine the instantaneous rate, as it is measured by determination of slope of the tangent at point $^ { \\bullet } t$ in concentration vs time plot (Fig. 3. 1). This makes it difficult to determine the rate law and hence the order of the reaction. In order to avoid this difficulty, we can integrate the differential rate equation to give a relation between directly measured experimental data, i.e., concentrations at different times and rate constant. \n\nThe integrated rate equations are different for the reactions of different reaction orders. We shall determine these equations only for zero and first order chemical reactions. \n\n3.3.1 Zero Order Reactions \n\nZero order reaction means that the rate of the reaction is proportional to zero power of the concentration of reactants. Consider the reaction, \n\nR → P \n\nAs any quantity raised to power zero is unity \n\nIntegrating both sides \n\nwhere, I is the constant of integration. \n\nAt $t = 0$ , the concentration of the reactant $\\mathrm { R } = \\left[ \\mathrm { R } \\right] _ { 0 }$ where $[ \\mathrm { R } ] _ { 0 }$ is initial concentration of the reactant. \n\nSubstituting in equation (3.5) \n\nSubstituting the value of I in the equation (3.5) \n\nComparing (3.6) with equation of a straight line, $\\mathbf { y } = \\mathbf { m } \\mathbf { x } + \\mathbf { c }$ , if we plot [R] against t, we get a straight line (Fig. 3.3) with slope $\\ c = - k$ and intercept equal to $\\left[ \\operatorname { R } \\right] _ { 0 }$ \n\nFurther simplifying equation (3.6), we get the rate constant, $k$ as \n\nZero order reactions are relatively uncommon but they occur under special conditions. Some enzyme catalysed reactions and reactions which occur on metal surfaces are a few examples of zero order reactions. The decomposition of gaseous ammonia on a hot platinum surface is a zero order reaction at high pressure. \n\nIn this reaction, platinum metal acts as a catalyst. At high pressure, the metal surface gets saturated with gas molecules. So, a further change in reaction conditions is unable to alter the amount of ammonia on the surface of the catalyst making rate of the reaction independent of its concentration. The thermal decomposition of HI on gold surface is another example of zero order reaction. \n\n3.3.2 First Order Reactions \n\nIn this class of reactions, the rate of the reaction is proportional to the first power of the concentration of the reactant R. For example, \n\nIntegrating this equation, we get \n\nAgain, I is the constant of integration and its value can be determined easily. \n\nwhen $t = 0$ , $\\mathrm { R } = \\left[ \\mathrm { R } \\right] _ { 0 }$ where $[ \\mathrm { R } ] _ { 0 }$ is the initial concentration of the reactant. \n\nTherefore, equation (3.8) can be written as \n\nSubstituting the value of I in equation (3.8) $\\ln [ \\mathrm { R } ] = - k t + \\ln [ \\mathrm { R } ] _ { 0 }$ \n\nRearranging this equation \n\nAt time $t _ { 1 }$ from equation (3.8) \n\nAt time $t _ { 2 }$ \n\nwhere, $[ \\mathrm { R } ] _ { 1 }$ and $\\left[ \\operatorname { R } \\right] _ { 2 }$ are the concentrations of the reactants at time $t _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 1 }$ and $t _ { 2 }$ respectively. \n\nSubtracting (3.12) from (3.11) \n\nEquation (3.9) can also be writen as \n\nTaking antilog of both sides \n\nComparing equation (3.9) with ${ \\bf y } = { \\bf m } { \\bf x } + { \\bf c }$ , if we plot In [R] against $t$ (Fig. 3.4) we get a straight line with slope $= - k$ and intercept equal to ln $[ \\mathrm { R } ] _ { 0 }$ (cid:) \n\nThe first order rate equation (3.1O) can also be written in the form \n\nIf we plot a graph between log $[ \\mathrm { R } ] _ { 0 } / [ \\mathrm { R } ]$ vs t, (Fig. 3.5), the slope $= \\ k / 2 . 3 0 3$ \n\nHydrogenation of ethene is an example of first order reaction. \n\nAll natural and artificial radioactive decay of unstable nuclei take place by first order kinetics. \n\nDecomposition of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 }$ and $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ are some more examples of first order reactions. - \n\nExample 3.5 The initial concentration of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 }$ in the following first order reaction (cid:) $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 } ( \\mathrm { g } )  2 \\mathrm { N O } _ { 2 } ( \\mathrm { g } ) + 1 / 2 \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } ( \\mathrm { g }$ was $1 . 2 4 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 2 }$ mol $\\mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 }$ at $3 1 8 ~ \\mathrm { K }$ The concentration of $\\mathrm { { N } } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { { O } } _ { 5 }$ after 60 minutes was $0 . 2 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 2 } \\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 }$ . Calculate the rate constant of the reaction at $3 1 8 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ . \n\nSolution For a first order reaction \n\nLet us consider a typical first order gas phase reaction \n\nLet $p _ { \\mathrm { i } }$ be the initial pressure of A and $p _ { \\mathrm { t } }$ the total pressure at time $\\cdot _ { t }$ . Integrated rate equation for such a reaction can be derived as \n\nTotal pressure $p _ { \\mathrm { t } } = p _ { \\mathrm { A } } + p _ { \\mathrm { B } } + p _ { \\mathrm { C } }$ (pressure units) \n\n$p _ { \\mathrm { { A } } } , p _ { \\mathrm { { B } } }$ and $p _ { \\mathrm { c } }$ are the partial pressures of A, B and C, respectively. \n\nIf $\\mathbf { x }$ atm be the decrease in pressure of A at time $t$ and one mole each of B and $\\mathrm { \\bf C }$ is being formed, the increase in pressure of B and C will also be $\\mathbf { x }$ atm each. \n\n$\\begin{array} { r l } { \\mathrm { A ( g ) } \\quad } & { { } \\to \\quad \\quad \\mathrm { B ( g ) } } \\\\ { p _ { \\mathrm { i } } \\mathrm { a t m } \\quad } & { { } \\ : \\ : 0 \\mathrm { a t m } } \\\\ { ( p _ { \\mathrm { i } } \\mathrm { - x } ) \\mathrm { a t m } \\quad } & { { } \\ : \\mathrm { x } \\mathrm { a t m } } \\end{array}$ + C(g) At $t = 0$ (cid:) 0atm At time $t$ (cid:) xatm \n\nwhere, $p _ { \\mathrm { i } }$ is the initial pressure at time $t = 0$ \n\nThe following data were obtained during the first order thermal Example 3.6 decomposition of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 }$ (g) at constant yolume: \n\nCalculate the rate constant. \n\nSolution \n\nLet the pressure of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 } ( \\mathrm { g } )$ decrease by $2 \\mathbf { x }$ atm.

It is represented as $t _ { 1 / 2 }$ \n\nFor a zero order reaction, rate constant is given by equation 3.7. \n\nThe rate constant at $\\mathrm { t } _ { 1 / 2 }$ becomes \n\nIt is clear that $t _ { { \\scriptscriptstyle 1 } / { \\scriptscriptstyle 2 } }$ for a zero order reaction is directly proportional to the initial concentration of the reactants and inversely proportional to the rate constant. \n\nFor the first order reaction, \n\nSo, the above equation becomes \n\nIt can be seen that for a first order reaction, half-life period is constant, i.e., it is independent of initial concentration of the reacting species. The half-life of a first order equation is readily calculated from the rate constant and vice versa. \n\nFor zero order reaction $t _ { \\scriptscriptstyle { 1 / 2 } } \\propto [ \\mathbb { R } ] _ { 0 }$ .

There are many reactions which obey first order rate law although they are higher order reactions. Consider the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate which is a chemical reaction between ethyl acetate and water. In reality, it is a second order reaction and concentration of both ethyl acetate and water affect the rate of the reaction. But water is taken in large excess for hydrolysis, therefore, concentration of water is not altered much during the reaction. Thus, the rate of reaction is affected by concentration of ethyl acetate only. For example, during the hydrolysis of $0 . 0 1 \\mathrm { \\ m o l }$ of ethyl acetate with $1 0 \\mathrm { \\ m o l }$ of water, amounts of the reactants and products at the beginning $\\left( t = 0 \\right]$ and completion (t) of the reaction are given as under. \n\nThe concentration of water does not get altered much during the course of the reaction. So, the reaction behaves as first order reaction. Such reactions are called pseudo first order reactions. \n\nInversion of cane sugar is another pseudo first order reaction. \n\nC12H22O11 + H_₂O \\$H+\\$ + CfH12O6 Cane sugar Glucose Fructose Rate = k [C12H22011 \n\nIntext Questions \n\n3.5 A first order reaction has a rate constant $1 . 1 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \\mathrm { s ^ { - 1 } }$ .

If the decomposition is a first order reaction, calculate the rate constant of the reaction. \n\n3.4 Temperature Dependence of the Rate of a Reaction \n\nMost of the chemical reactions are accelerated by increase in temperature. For example, in decomposition of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 }$ , the time taken for half of the original amount of material to decompose is $1 2 \\ \\mathrm { m i n }$ at $5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , $^ { 5 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ at $2 5 \\mathrm { { ^ \\circ C } }$ and 10 days at $0 \\%$ . You also know that in a mixture of potassium permanganate $\\mathrm { ( K M n O _ { 4 } ) }$ and oxalic acid $\\mathrm { ( H _ { 2 } C _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } ) }$ , potassium permanganate gets decolourised faster at a higher temperature than that at a lower temperature. \n\nIt has been found that for a chemical reaction with rise in temperature by $\\mathbf { 1 0 ^ { \\circ } }$ , the rate constant is nearly doubled. \n\nThe temperature dependence of the rate of a chemical reaction can be accurately explained by Arrhenius equation (3.18). It was first proposed by Dutch chemist, J.H. van't Hoff but Swedish chemist, Arrhenius provided its physical justification and interpretation. \n\nwhere $A$ is the Arrhenius factor or the frequency factor. It is also called pre-exponential factor. It is a constant specific to a particular reaction. $R$ is gas constant and $E _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ is activation energy measured in joules/mole $( \\mathrm { J \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } } )$ . \n\nIt can be understood clearly using the following simple reaction \n\nAccording to Arrhenius, this reaction can take place only when a molecule of hydrogen and a molecule of iodine collide to form an unstable intermediate (Fig. 3.6). It exists for a very short time and then breaks up to form two molecules of hydrogen iodide. \n\nThe energy required to form this intermediate, called activated complex (C), is known as activation energy $( \\pmb { { \\cal E } } _ { \\mathbf { a } } )$ . Fig. 3.7 is obtained by plotting potential energy vs reaction coordinate. Reaction coordinate represents the profile of energy change when reactants change into products. \n\nSome energy is released when the complex decomposes to form products. So, the final enthalpy of the reaction depends upon the nature of reactants and products. ▲ \n\nAll the molecules in the reacting species do not have the same kinetic energy. Since it is difficult to predict the behaviour of any one molecule with precision, Ludwig Boltzmann and James Clark Maxwell used statistics to predict the behaviour of large number of molecules. According to them, the distribution of kinetic energy may be described by plotting the fraction of molecules $( N _ { \\mathrm { E } } / N _ { \\mathrm { T } } )$ with a given kinetic energy $\\mathrm { ( E ) }$ vs kinetic energy (Fig. 3.8). Here, $N _ { \\mathrm { E } }$ is the number of molecules with energy $E$ and $N _ { \\mathrm { { T } } }$ is total number of molecules. \n\nThe peak of the curve corresponds to the most probable kinetic energy, i.e., kinetic energy of maximum fraction of molecules. There are decreasing number of molecules with energies higher or lower than this value. When the temperature is raised, the maximum of the curve moves to the higher energy value (Fig. 3.9) and the curve broadens out, i.e., spreads to the right such that there is a greater proportion of molecules with much higher energies. The area under the curve must be constant since total probability must be one at all times. We can mark the position of $E _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ on Maxwell Boltzmann distribution curve (Fig. 3.9). \n\nIncreasing the temperature of the substance increases the fraction of molecules, which collide with energies greater than $E _ { \\mathrm { a } } . \\ \\mathrm { I t }$ is clear from the diagram that in the curve at $\\left( t + \\ 1 0 \\right)$ , the area showing the fraction of molecules having energy equal to or greater than activation energy gets doubled leading to doubling the rate of a reaction. \n\nIn the Arrhenius equation (3.18) the factor $\\mathrm { e } ^ { - E \\mathrm { a } \\ / R T }$ corresponds to the fraction of molecules that have kinetic energy greater than $E _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ Taking natural logarithm of both sides of equation (3.18) \n\nThe plot of In $k$ vs $1 / \\mathrm { T }$ gives a straight line according to the equation (3.19) as shown in Fig. 3.10. \n\nThus, it has been found from Arrhenius equation (3.18) that increasing the temperature or decreasing the activation energy will result in an increase in the rate of the reaction and an exponential increase in the rate constant. \n\nIn Fig. 3.10, $\\mathrm { s l o p e } = - \\ \\frac { E _ { \\mathrm { a } } } { R }$ and intercept $\\mathit { \\Theta } = \\ l \\mathrm { n }$ \n\nA. So we can calculate $E _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ and $A$ using these values. \n\nAt temperature $T _ { 1 }$ , equation (3.19) is \n\nAt temperature $T _ { 2 }$ , equation (3.19) is \n\n(since $A$ is constant for a given reaction) \n\n(cid:) $k _ { 1 }$ and $k _ { 2 }$ are the values of rate constants at temperatures $T _ { 1 }$ and $T _ { 2 }$ respectively. \n\nSubtracting equation (3.20) from (3.21), we obtain \n\nExample 3.9 \n\nThe rate constants of a reaction at 5ooK and 7ooK are $0 . 0 2 \\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ and $0 . 0 7 \\mathrm { { s } ^ { - 1 } }$ respectively. Calculate the values of $E _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ and $A .$ \n\nSolution \n\nSin \n\nExample 3.10 \n\nThe first order rate constant for the decomposition of ethyl iodide by the reaction \n\nat 600K is $1 . 6 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \\mathrm { s ^ { - 1 } }$ . Its energy of activation is 209 kJ/mol.   \nCalculate the rate constant of the reaction at 70oK. \n\nWe know that \n\n3.4.1 Effect of Catalyst \n\nA catalyst is a substance which increases the rate of a reaction without itself undergoing any permanent chemical change. For example, $\\mathbf { M n O } _ { 2 }$ catalyses the following reaction so as to increase its rate considerably. \n\nThe word catalyst should not be used when the added substance reduces the rate of raction. The substance is then called inhibitor. The action of the catalyst can be explained by intermediate complex theory. According to this theory, a catalyst participates in a chemical reaction by forming temporary bonds with the reactants resulting in an intermediate complex. This has a transitory existence and decomposes to yield products and the catalyst. \n\nIt is believed that the catalyst provides an alternate pathway or reaction mechanism by reducing the activation energy between reactants and products and hence lowering the potential energy barrier as shown in Fig. 3.11. \n\n- It is clear from Arrhenius equation (3.18) that lower the value of activation energy faster will be the rate of a reaction. \n\nA small amount of the catalyst can catalyse a large amount of reactants. A catalyst does not alter Gibbs energy, ∆G of a reaction. It catalyses the spontaneous reactions but does not catalyse non-spontaneous reactions. It is also found that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium constant of a reaction rather, it helps in attaining the equilibrium faster, that is, it catalyses the forward as well as the backward reactions to the same extent so that the equilibrium state remains same but is reached earlier. \n\nThough Arrhenius equation is applicable under a wide range of circumstances, collision theory, which was developed by Max Trautz and William Lewis in 1916 -18, provides a greater insight into the energetic and mechanistic aspects of reactions. It is based on kinetic theory of gases. According to this theory, the reactant molecules are assumed to be hard spheres and reaction is postulated to occur when molecules collide with each other. The number of collisions per second per unit volume of the reaction mixture is known as collision frequency $\\mathbf { ( } \\mathbf { Z } \\mathbf { ) }$ . Another factor which affects the rate of chemical reactions is activation energy (as we have already studied). For a bimolecular elementary reaction \n\nrate of reaction can be expressed as \n\nwhere $Z _ { \\mathrm { A B } }$ represents the collision frequency of reactants, A and B and e-Ea /R represents the fraction of molecules with energies equal to or greater than $E _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ . Comparing (3.23) with Arrhenius equation, we can say that $A$ is related to collision frequency. \n\nEquation (3.23) predicts the value of rate constants fairly accurately for the reactions that involve atomic species or simple molecules but for complex molecules significant deviations are observed. The reason could be that all collisions do not lead to the formation of products. The collisions in which molecules collide with sufficient kinetic energy (called threshold energy\\*) and proper orientation, so as to facilitate breaking of bonds between reacting species and formation of new bonds to form products are called as effective collisions. \n\nFor example, formation of methanol from bromoethane depends upon the orientation of reactant molecules as shown in Fig. 3.12. The proper orientation of reactant molecules lead to bond formation whereas improper orientation makes them simply bounce back and no products are formed. \n\nTo account for effective collisions, another factor $P _ { \\ast }$ , called the probability or steric factor is introduced. It takes into account the fact that in a collision, molecules must be properly oriented i.e., \n\nThus, in collision theory activation energy and proper orientation of the molecules together determine the criteria for an effective collision and hence the rate of a chemical reaction. \n\nCollision theory also has certain drawbacks as it considers atoms/ molecules to be hard spheres and ignores their structural aspect. You will study details about this theory and more on other theories in your higher classes. \n\nIntext Questions \n\n3.7 what will be the effect of temperature on rate constant ? \n\n3.8 The rate of the chemical reaction doubles for an increase of 1oK in absolute temperature from 298K.

The rate of a reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration of reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time. It can be expressed as instantaneous rate at a particular instant of time and average rate over a large interval of time. A number of factors such as temperature, concentration of reactants, catalyst, affect the rate of a reaction. Mathematical representation of rate of a reaction is given by rate law. It has to be determined experimentally and cannot be predicted. Order of a reaction with respect to a reactant is the power of its concentration which appears in the rate law equation. The order of a reaction is the sum of all such powers of concentration of terms for different reactants. Rate constant is the proportionality factor in the rate law. Rate constant and order of a reaction can be determined from rate law or its integrated rate equation. Molecularity is defined only for an elementary reaction. Its values are limited from 1 to 3 whereas order can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or even a fraction. Molecularity and order of an elementary reaction are same. \n\nTemperature dependence of rate constants is described by Arrhenius equation $\\begin{array} { r } { \\left( k \\ = \\ A \\mathrm { e } ^ { - E \\mathrm { a } / R T } \\right) } \\end{array}$ $E _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ corresponds to the activation energy and is given by the energy difference between activated complex and the reactant molecules, and $A$ (Arrhenius factor or pre-exponential factor) corresponds to the collision frequency. The equation clearly shows that increase of temperature or lowering of $\\mathrm { E _ { a } }$ will lead to an increase in the rate of reaction and presence of a catalyst lowers the activation energy by providing an alternate path for the reaction. According to collision theory, another factor $P$ called steric factor which refers to the orientation of molecules which collide, is important and contributes to effective collisions, thus, modifying the Arrhenius equation to $k = P Z _ { \\mathrm { A B } } \\mathrm { e } ^ { - E _ { \\mathrm { a } } / R T }$ . \n\n3.1 From the rate expression for the following reactions, determine their order of reaction and the dimensions of the rate constants. \n\n(i) $3 \\mathrm { N O } ( \\mathrm { g } )  \\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ (g) Rate $\\mathbf { \\mu } = \\mathbf { \\mu } _ { k [ \\mathbf { N O } ] } 2$   \n(ii (i $\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\mathrm { ~ ) ~ H _ 2 O _ 2 ~ ( a q ) \\ + \\ 3 I ^ { - } \\ ( a q ) \\ + \\ 2 H ^ { + } \\  \\ 2 H _ { 2 } O \\ ( l ) \\ + \\ \\Gamma _ { 3 } ^ { - } \\quad R a t e \\ = \\ k [ H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 } ] [ \\Gamma ] } } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { ~ } } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { ~ } } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { ~ } } \\end{array}$   \n(iv \n\n3.2 For the reaction: \n\nthe rate $\\mathbf { \\mu } = \\mathbf { \\mu } _ { k [ \\mathrm { A l } [ \\mathrm { B } ] } 2$ with $\\mathrm { \\bf ~ k } = 2 . 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } \\mathrm { \\bf ~ m o l } ^ { - 2 } \\mathrm { \\bf ~ L } ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { \\bf ~ s } ^ { - 1 }$ .

    "content": "Objectives \n\nAfter studying this Unit, you will be able to \n\nlearn the positions of the $d -$ and $f$ block elements in the periodic table; know the electronic configurations of the transition $d$ -block) and the inner transition $ ^ { f }$ block) elements; appreciate the relative stability of various oxidation states in terms of electrode potential values;   \n0 describe the preparation, properties, structures and uses of some important compounds such as $\\mathrm { K _ { 2 } C r _ { 2 } O _ { 7 } }$ and ${ \\mathrm { K M n O } } _ { 4 }$ ;   \nunderstand the general characteristics of the $d -$ and $f$ -block elements and the general horizontal and group trends in them;   \n• describe the properties of the $f$ -block elements and give a comparative account of the lanthanoids and actinoids with respect to their electronic configurations, oxidation states and chemical behaviour. \n\nIron, copper, silver and gold are among the transition elements that have played important roles in the development of human civilisation. The inner transition elements such as $T h S P a$ and $y$ are proving excellent sources of nuclear energy in modern times. \n\nThe $d$ -block of the periodic table contains the elements of the groups 3-12 in which the $d$ orbitals are progressively filled in each of the four long periods. The $f -$ block consists of elements in which 4 $f$ and 5 $f$ orbitals are progressively filled. They are placed in a separate panel at the bottom of the periodic table. The names transition metals and inner transition metals are often used to refer to the elements of $d \\cdot$ -and $f$ blocks respectively. \n\nThere are mainly four series of the transition metals, $3 d$ series (Sc to Zn), $4 d$ series (Y to Cd), $5 d$ series (La and Hf to Hg) and $6 d$ series which has Ac and elements from Rf to Cn. The two series of the inner transition metals; $4 f$ (Ce to Lu) and $5 f$ (Th to Lr) are known as lanthanoids and actinoids respectively. \n\nOriginally the name transition metals was derived from the fact that their chemical properties were transitional between those of $s$ and $p { \\cdot }$ -block elements. Now according to IUPAC, transition metals are defined as metals which have incomplete $d$ subshell either in neutral atom or in their ions. Zinc, cadmium and mercury of group 12 have full $d ^ { 1 0 }$ configuration in their ground state as well as in their common oxidation states and hence, are not regarded as transition metals. However, being the end members of the $3 d .$ , $4 d$ and $5 d$ transition series, respectively, their chemistry is studied along with the chemistry of the transition metals. \n\nThe presence of partly filled $d$ or $f$ orbitals in their atoms makes transition elements different from that of the non-transition elements. Hence, transition elements and their compounds are studied separately. However, the usual theory of valence as applicable to the nontransition elements can be applied successfully to the transition elements also. \n\nVarious precious metals such as silver, gold and platinum and industrially important metals like iron, copper and titanium belong to the transition metals series. \n\nIn this Unit, we shall first deal with the electronic configuration, occurrence and general characteristics of transition elements with special emphasis on the trends in the properties of the first row $( 3 d )$ transition metals along with the preparation and properties of some important compounds. This will be followed by consideration of certain general aspects such as electronic configurations, oxidation states and chemical reactivity of the inner transition metals. \n\nTHE TRANSITION ELEMENTS (d-BLOCK) \n\nThe $d$ -block occupies the large middle section of the periodic table flanked between $s -$ and $p -$ blocks in the periodic table. The $d$ -orbitals of the penultimate energy level of atoms receive electrons giving rise to four rows of the transition metals, i.e., 3d, $4 d$ ,id $5 d$ and $6 d .$ All these series of transition elements are shown in Table 4.1. \n\nIn general the electronic configuration of outer orbitals of these elements iS $\\overline { { { \\bf n } } } - 1 ) d ^ { 1 - 1 0 } { \\bf n } s ^ { 1 - 2 }$ e f selct c $4 d ^ { 1 0 } 5 s ^ { 0 }$ The (n–l) stands for the inner $d$ orbitals which may have one to ten electrons and the outermost ns orbital may have one or two electrons. However, this generalisation has several exceptions because of very little energy difference between $( \\mathrm { n - 1 } ) d$ and ns orbitals. Furthermore, half and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A consequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations of Cr and Cu in the $3 d$ series. For example, consider the case of Cr, which has $3 d ^ { 5 } 4 s ^ { 1 }$ configuration instead of $3 d ^ { 4 } 4 s ^ { 2 }$ ;the energy gap between the two sets $3 d$ and 4s) of orbitals is small enough to prevent electron entering the $3 d$ orbitals. Similarly in case of Cu, the configuration is $3 d ^ { 1 0 } 4 s ^ { 1 }$ and not $3 d ^ { 9 } 4 s ^ { 2 }$ . The ground state electronic configurations of the outer orbitals of transition elements are given in Table 4.1. \n\nThe electronic configurations of outer orbitals of $Z \\mathrm { n }$ , Cd, $\\mathrm { H g }$ and Cn are represented by the general formula $( \\mathrm { n - 1 } ) d ^ { 1 0 } \\mathrm { n } s ^ { 2 }$ . The orbitals in these elements are completely filled in the ground state as well as in their common oxidation states. Therefore, they are not regarded as transition elements. \n\nThe $d$ orbitals of the transition elements protrude to the periphery of an atom more than the other orbitals (i.e., s and $p )$ , hence, they are more influenced by the surroundings as well as affect the atoms or molecules surrounding them. In some respects, ions of a given $d ^ { \\mathrm { n } }$ configuration $( { \\bf n } = 1 - 9 )$ have similar magnetic and electronic properties. With partly filled $d$ orbitals these elements exhibit certain characteristic properties such as display of a variety of oxidation states, formation of coloured ions and entering into complex formation with a variety of ligands. \n\nThe transition metals and their compounds also exhibit catalytic property and paramagnetic behaviour. All these characteristics have been discussed in detail later in this Unit. \n\nThere are greater similarities in the properties of the transition elements of a horizontal row in contrast to the non-transition elements. However, some group similarities also exist. We shall first study the general characteristics and their trends in the horizontal rows (particularly $3 d$ row) and then consider some group similarities. \n\nIntext Question \n\n4.1 Silver atom has completely filled $d$ orbitals $( 4 d ^ { 1 0 } )$ in its ground state. How can you say that it is a transition element? \n\nWe will discuss the properties of elements of first transition series only in the following sections. \n\n4.3 Seneral Properties of the Transition Elements (d-Block) \n\n4.3.1 Physical Properties \n\nNearly all the transition elements display typical metallic properties such as high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, high thermal and electrical conductivity and metallic lustre. with the exceptions of Zn, Cd, Hg and Mn, they have one or more typical metallic structures at normal temperatures. - \n\nThe transition metals (with the exception of $Z \\mathrm { n }$ , Cd and Hg) are very hard and have low volatility. Their melting and boiling points are high. Fig. 4.1 depicts the melting points of transition metals belonging to $3 d$ , $4 d$ and $5 d$ series. The high melting points of these metals are attributed to the involvement of greater number of electrons from $( \\mathrm { n - 1 } ) d$ in addition to the ns electrons in the interatomic metallic bonding. In any row the melting points of these metals rise to a maximum at $d ^ { 5 }$ except for anomalous values of Mn and Tc and fall regularly as the atomic number increases. They have high enthalpies of atomisation which are shown in Fig. 4.2. The maxima at about the middle of each series indicate that one unpaired electron per $d$ orbital is particularly favourable for strong interatomic interaction. In general, greater the number of valence electrons, stronger is the resultant bonding. Since the enthalpy of atomisation is an important factor in determining the standard electrode potential of a metal, metals with very high enthalpy of atomisation (i.e., very high boiling point) tend to be noble in their reactions (see later for electrode potentials). \n\nAnother generalisation that may be drawn from Fig. 4.2 is that the metals of the second and third series have greater enthalpies of atomisation than the corresponding elements of the first series; this is an important factor in accounting for the occurrence of much more frequent metal – metal bonding in compounds of the heavy transition metals. \n\n4.3.2 Variation in Atomic and Ionic Sizes of Transition Metals \n\nIn general, ions of the same charge in a given series show progressive decrease in radius with increasing atomic number. This is because the new electron enters a $d$ orbital each time the nuclear charge increases by unity. It may be recalled that the shielding effect of a $d$ electron is not that effective, hence the net electrostatic attraction between the nuclear charge and the outermost electron increases and the ionic radius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a given series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An interesting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series are compared with those of the corresponding elements in the other series. The curves in Fig. 4.3 show an increase from the first $( 3 d )$ to the second $( 4 d )$ series of the elements but the radii of the third $( 5 d )$ series are virtually the same as those of the corresponding members of the second series. This phenomenon is associated with the intervention of the $4 f$ orbitals which must be filled before the $5 d$ series of elements begin. The filling of $4 f$ before $5 d$ orbital results in a regular decrease in atomic radii called Lanthanoid contraction which essentially compensates for the expected increase in atomic size with increasing atomic number. The net result of the lanthanoid contraction is that the second and the third $d$ series exhibit similar radii (e.g., $Z \\mathrm { r } ~ 1 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { p m }$ , Hf $1 5 9 \\mathrm { p m } )$ and have very similar physical and chemical properties much more than that expected on the basis of usual family relationship. \n\nThe factor responsible for the lanthanoid contraction is somewhat similar to that observed in an ordinary transition series and is attributed to similar cause, i.e., the imperfect shielding of one electron by another in the same set of orbitals. However, the shielding of one $4 f$ electron by another is less than that of one $d$ electron by another, and as the nuclear charge increases along the series, there is fairly regular decrease in the size of the entire $4 f ^ { \\mathrm { n } }$ orbitals. \n\nThe decrease in metallic radius coupled with increase in atomic mass results in a general increase in the density of these elements. Thus, from titanium $\\left( Z = 2 2 \\right)$ to copper $( Z \\ : = \\ : 2 9 )$ the significant increase in the density may be noted (Table 4.2). \n\nWhy do the transition elements exhibit higher enthalpies of atomisation? \n\nBecause of large number of unpaired electrons in their atoms they have stronger interatomic interaction and hence stronger bonding between atoms resulting in higher enthalpies of atomisation. \n\nIntexct Question \n\n4.2 In the series Sc $\\left( Z = 2 1 \\right)$ to $Z \\mathrm { n }$ (cid:) $\\left( Z = 3 0 \\right)$ , the enthalpy of atomisation of zinc is the lowest, i.e., $1 2 6 ~ \\mathrm { k J ~ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ . Why? \n\n4.3.3 Ionisation Enthalpies \n\nThere is an increase in ionisation enthalpy along each series of the transition elements from left to right due to an increase in nuclear charge which accompanies the filling of the inner $d$ orbitals. Table 4.2 gives the values of the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first series of transition elements. These values show that the successive enthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the case of non-transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along a series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation along a period of non-transition elements. The first ionisation enthalpy, in general, increases, but the magnitude of the increase in the second and third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements, is much higher along a series. \n\nThe irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the metals of $3 d$ series, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for by considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies of $4 s$ and $3 d$ orbitals. You have learnt that when $d$ -block elements form ions, ns electrons are lost before $( n - 1 )$ (cid:) $d$ electrons. As we move along the period in $3 d$ series, we see that nuclear charge increases from scandium to zinc but electrons are added to the orbital of inner subshell, i.e., $3 d$ orbitals. These $3 d$ electrons shield the $4 s$ electrons from the increasing nuclear charge somewhat more effectively than the outer shell electrons can shield one another. Therefore, the atomic radii decrease less rapidly. Thus, ionization energies increase only slightly along the $3 d$ series. The doubly or more highly charged ions have $d ^ { \\mathrm { n } }$ configurations with no 4s electrons. A general trend of increasing values of second ionisation enthalpy is expected as the effective nuclear charge increases because one $d$ electron does not shield another electron from the influence of nuclear charge because $d$ -orbitals differ in direction. However, the trend of steady increase in second and third ionisation enthalpy breaks for the formation of $\\mathrm { { M n ^ { 2 + } } }$ and $\\mathrm { F e ^ { 3 + } }$ respectively. In both the cases, ions have $d ^ { 5 }$ configuration. Similar breaks occur at corresponding elements in the later transition series. \n\nThe interpretation of variation in ionisation enthalpy for an electronic configuration $d ^ { n }$ is as follows: \n\nThe three terms responsible for the value of ionisation enthalpy are attraction of each electron towards nucleus, repulsion between the electrons and the exchange energy. Exchange energy is responsible for the stabilisation of energy state. Exchange energy is approximately proportional to the total number of possible pairs of parallel spins in the degenerate orbitals. when several electrons occupy a set of degenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum possible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins (Hunds rule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability increases, the ionisation becomes more difficult. There is no loss of exchange energy at $d ^ { 6 }$ configuration. $\\mathrm { { M n ^ { + } } }$ has $3 d ^ { 5 } 4 s ^ { 1 }$ configuration and configuration of $\\mathrm { { C r ^ { + } } }$ is $d ^ { 5 }$ , therefore, ionisation enthalpy of $\\mathrm { M n ^ { + } }$ is lower than $\\mathrm { { C r ^ { + } } }$ . In the same way, $\\mathrm { F e ^ { 2 + } }$ has $d ^ { 6 }$ configuration and $\\mathrm { M n ^ { 2 + } }$ has $3 d ^ { 5 }$ configuration. Hence, ionisation enthalpy of $\\mathrm { F e ^ { 2 + } }$ is lower than the $\\mathrm { M n ^ { 2 + } }$ . In other words, we can say that the third ionisation enthalpy of Fe is lower than that of Mn. ▲ \n\nThe lowest common oxidation state of these metals is $+ 2$ . To form the $\\mathbf { M } ^ { 2 + }$ ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and second ionisation enthalpy is required in addition to the enthalpy of atomisation. The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy which shows unusually high values for $\\mathrm { C r }$ and Cu where $\\mathbf { M } ^ { + }$ ions have the $d ^ { 5 }$ and $d ^ { 1 0 }$ configurations respectively. The value for $Z \\mathrm { n }$ is correspondingly low as the ionisation causes the removal of one $4 s$ electron which results in the formation of stable $d ^ { 1 0 }$ configuration. The trend in the third ionisation enthalpies is not complicated by the $4 s$ orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an electron from the $d ^ { 5 } \\ ( \\mathrm { M n } ^ { 2 + } )$ and $d ^ { 1 0 } ( Z \\mathrm n ^ { 2 + } )$ ions. In general, the third ionisation enthalpies are quite high. Also the high values for third ionisation enthalpies of copper, nickel and zinc indicate why it is difficult to obtain oxidation state greater than two for these elements. \n\nAlthough ionisation enthalpies give some guidance concerning the relative stabilities of oxidation states, this problem is very complex and not amenable to ready generalisation. \n\n4.3.4 Oxidation States \n\nOne of the notable features of a transition elements is the great variety of oxidation states these may show in their compounds. Table 4.3 lists the common oxidation states of the first row transition elements. \n\nThe elements which give the greatest number of oxidation states occur in or near the middle of the series. Manganese, for example, exhibits all the oxidation states from $+ 2$ to $+ 7$ . The lesser number of oxidation states at the extreme ends stems from either too few electrons to lose or share (Sc, Ti) or too many $d$ electrons (hence fewer orbitals available in which to share electrons with others) for higher valence (Cu, Zn). Thus, early in the series scandium(Il) is virtually unknown and titanium (IV) is more stable than Ti(l) or Ti(II). At the other end, the only oxidation state of zinc is $+ 2$ (no $d$ electrons are involved). The maximum oxidation states of reasonable stability correspond in value to the sum of the $s$ and $d$ electrons upto manganese $\\mathrm { \\bar { ( T i } ^ { \\mathrm { { I V } } } O _ { 2 } }$ , ${ \\mathrm { V } } ^ { \\mathrm { v } } { \\mathrm { O } } _ { 2 } ^ { + }$ , $\\mathrm { C r } ^ { \\mathrm { V 1 } } \\mathrm { O } _ { 4 } ^ { 2 - }$ , $\\bf { M n } ^ { \\mathrm { { W I I } } } \\bf { O } _ { 4 } ^ { \\mathrm { ~ - } } )$ followed by a rather abrupt decrease in stability of higher oxidation states, so that the typical species to follow are $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { \\mathrm { I I , I I I } }$ , $\\mathrm { C o } ^ { \\mathrm { \\bar { I I } , I I I } }$ , $\\mathbf { N i } ^ { \\mathrm { I I } }$ , $\\mathrm { { C u } ^ { \\mathrm { { I , I I } } } }$ , $Z \\mathrm { n } ^ { \\mathrm { I I } }$ - \n\nThe variability of oxidation states, a characteristic of transition elements, arises out of incomplete filling of $d$ orbitals in such a way that their oxidation states differ from each other by unity, e.g., $\\mathrm { \\Delta V ^ { I I } , \\Delta V ^ { I I I } }$ , $\\mathrm { V } ^ { \\mathrm { I V } } , \\mathrm { V } ^ { \\mathrm { V } }$ . This is in contrast with the variability of oxidation states of non transition elements where oxidation states normally differ by a unit of two. \n\nAn interesting feature in the variability of oxidation states of the $d -$ block elements is noticed among the groups (groups 4 through 10). Although in the $p$ -block the lower oxidation states are favoured by the heavier members (due to inert pair effect), the opposite is true in the groups of $d$ -block. For example, in group 6, Mo(VI) and w(VI) are found to be more stable than $\\mathrm { C r ( V I ) }$ . Thus $\\mathrm { C r ( V I ) }$ in the form of dichromate in acidic medium is a strong oxidising agent, whereas $\\mathbf { M o O } _ { 3 }$ and $\\mathrm { W O } _ { 3 }$ are not. \n\nLow oxidation states are found when a complex compound has ligands capable of $\\pi$ -acceptor character in addition to the $\\sigma$ -bonding. For example, in $\\mathrm { N i ( C O ) _ { 4 } }$ and $\\mathrm { F e } ( \\mathrm { C O } ) _ { 5 }$ , the oxidation state of nickel and iron is zero. \n\nName a transition element which does not exhibit variable Example 4.3 oxidation states. Scandium $\\left( Z = 2 1 \\right)$ ) does not exhibit variable oxidation states. Solution \n\nIntext Question \n\n4.3 Which of the $3 d$ series of the transition metals exhibits the largest number of oxidation states and why? \n\n4.3.5 Trends in the $ { \\mathbf { M } } ^ { 2 + } /  { \\mathbf { M } }$ (cid:) Standard Electrode Potentials \n\nTable 4.4 contains the thermochemical parameters related to the transformation of the solid metal atoms to $\\hat { \\mathbf { M } } ^ { 2 + }$ ions in solution and their standard electrode potentials. The observed values of $E ^ { \\mathcal { O } }$ and those calculated using the data of Table 4.4 are compared in Fig. 4.4. \n\nThe unique behaviour of Cu, having a positive $E ^ { \\mathcal { O } }$ , accounts for its inability to liberate $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ from acids. Only oxidising acids (nitric and hot concentrated sulphuric) react with Cu, the acids being reduced. The high energy to transform Cu(s) to $\\mathrm { C u ^ { 2 + } ( a q ) }$ is not balanced by its hydration enthalpy. The general trend towards less negative $E ^ { \\mathcal { O } }$ values across the series is related to the general increase in the sum of the first and second ionisation enthalpies. It is interesting to note that the value of $E ^ { \\mathcal { O } }$ for Mn, Ni and $Z \\mathrm { n }$ are more negative than expected from the trend. \n\nWhy is ${ \\mathrm { C r } } ^ { 2 + }$ reducing and $\\mathrm { M n } ^ { 3 + }$ oxidising when both have $d ^ { 4 }$ configuration? Example 4.4 $\\mathrm { C r } ^ { 2 + }$ is reducing as its configuration changes from $d ^ { 4 }$ to $\\boldsymbol { d } ^ { 3 }$ , the latter Solution having a half-filled $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ level (see Unit 5). On the other hand, the change from $\\mathrm { \\Delta } \\breve { \\bf M } \\mathrm { \\bf n } ^ { 3 + }$ to $\\mathrm { M n } ^ { 2 ^ { + } }$ results in the half-filled $( d ^ { 5 } )$ configuration which has extra stability. \n\nIntext Question \n\n4.4 The $E ^ { \\mathrm { { \\mathrm { { o } } } } } ( \\mathbf { M } ^ { 2 + } / \\mathbf { M } )$ value for copper is positive $\\mathrm { ( + 0 . 3 4 V ) }$ . What is possible reason for this? (Hint: consider its high $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { a } } H ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ and low $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { h y d } } H ^ { \\mathrm { o } } ]$ (id:) \n\nThe stability of the half-filled $d$ sub-shell in $\\mathrm { M n ^ { 2 + } }$ and the completely filled $d ^ { 1 0 }$ configuration in $Z \\mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ are related to their $E ^ { \\circ }$ values, whereas $E ^ { \\mathrm { { ^ { o } } } }$ for $\\mathbf { N i }$ is related to the highest negative $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { h y d } } H ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ \n\n4.3.6 Trends in the $ { \\mathbf { M } } ^ { 3 + } /  { \\mathbf { M } } ^ { 2 ^ { + } }$ Standard Electrode Potentials \n\nAn examination of the $E ^ { \\mathrm { o } } ( \\mathbf { M } ^ { 3 + } / \\mathbf { M } ^ { 2 + } )$ values (Table 4.2) shows the varying trends. The low value for Sc reflects the stability of ${ \\mathrm { S c } } ^ { 3 + }$ which has a noble gas configuration. The highest value for $Z \\mathrm { n }$ is due to the removal of an electron from the stable $d ^ { 1 0 }$ configuration of $Z \\mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ .  he comparatively high value for Mn shows that $\\mathrm { \\tilde { M n } } ^ { 2 + } ( d ^ { 5 } )$ is particularly stable, whereas comparatively low value for Fe shows the extra stability of $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + } \\ : ( d ^ { 5 } )$ . The comparatively low value for $\\mathrm { v }$ is related to the stability of $\\mathrm { V } ^ { 2 + }$ (half-fille $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ level, Unit 5). \n\n4.3.7 Trends in Stability of Higher Oxidation States \n\nTable 4.5 shows the stable halides of the $3 d$ series of transition metals. The highest oxidation numbers are achieved in $\\mathrm { T i X _ { 4 } }$ (tetrahalides), $\\mathrm { V F } _ { 5 }$ and $\\mathrm { C r F _ { 6 } }$ The $+ 7$ state for Mn is not represented in simple halides but $\\mathbf { M n O _ { 3 } F }$ is known, and beyond Mn no metal has a trihalide except $\\mathrm { F e X _ { 3 } }$ and $\\mathrm { C o F _ { 3 } }$ . The ability of fluorine to stabilise the highest oxidation state is due to either higher lattice energy as in the case of $\\mathrm { C o F _ { 3 } }$ , or higher bond enthalpy terms for the higher covalent compounds, e.g., $\\mathrm { V F } _ { 5 }$ and $\\mathrm { C r F _ { 6 } }$ \n\nAlthough ${ \\mathrm { V } } ^ { + 5 }$ is represented only by $\\mathrm { V F } _ { 5 }$ , the other halides, however, undergo hydrolysis to give oxohalides, $\\mathrm { { V O X } _ { 3 } }$ . Another feature of fluorides is their instability in the low oxidation states e.g., $\\mathrm { V X } _ { 2 }$ (cid:) $[ \\mathrm { X } = \\mathrm { C I }$ , Br or I) \n\nand the same applies to CuX. On the other hand, all $\\mathbf { C u } ^ { \\mathrm { { I I } } }$ halides are known except the iodide. In this case, $\\mathrm { { C u } ^ { 2 + } }$ oxidises $\\Gamma ^ { - }$ to $\\mathrm { I } _ { 2 }$ : \n\nHowever, many copper (I) compounds are unstable in aqueous solution and undergo disproportionation. \n\nThe stability of $\\mathrm { { C u } ^ { 2 + } }$ (aq) rather than $\\mathrm { { C u } ^ { + } ( a q ) }$ is due to the much more negative $\\mathrm { \\Delta \\Delta \\Delta \\Delta \\Delta H ^ { o } }$ of $\\mathrm { { \\hat { C } } u } ^ { 2 + }$ (aq) than $\\mathrm { C u } ^ { + }$ , which more than compensates for the second ionisation enthalpy of Cu. \n\nThe ability of oxygen to stabilise the highest oxidation state is demonstrated in the oxides. The highest oxidation number in the oxides (Table 4.6) coincides with the group number and is attained in $\\mathrm { S c _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } }$ to $\\bf { M n } _ { 2 } \\bf { O } _ { 7 }$ . Beyond Group 7, no higher oxides of Fe above $\\mathrm { F e _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } }$ are known, although ferrates $\\mathrm { ( V I ) ( F e O _ { 4 } ) ^ { \\bar { 2 } - } }$ , are formed in alkaline media but they readily decompose to $\\mathrm { F e _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } }$ and $\\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ . Besides the oxides, oxocations stabilise $\\mathrm { V } ^ { \\mathrm { v } }$ as ${ \\mathrm { V O } } _ { 2 } ^ { + }$ , $\\mathrm { V } ^ { \\mathrm { I V } }$ as ${ \\mathrm { V O } } ^ { 2 + }$ and $\\mathrm { T i } ^ { \\mathrm { { I V } } }$ as $\\mathrm { T i O } ^ { 2 + }$ . The ability of oxygen to stabilise these high oxidation states exceeds that of fluorine. Thus the highest Mn fluoride is $\\mathrm { M n F _ { 4 } }$ whereas the highest oxide is $\\bf { M n } _ { 2 } \\bf { O } _ { 7 }$ The ability of oxygen to form multiple bonds to metals explains its superiority. In the covalent oxide $\\bf { M n } _ { 2 } \\bf { O } _ { 7 }$ each Mn is tetrahedrally surrounded by O's including a Mn-O-Mn bridge. The tetrahedral $\\mathrm { [ M O _ { 4 } ] ^ { n - } }$ ions are known for $\\mathrm { v } _ { \\cdot } ^ { \\mathrm { v } }$ $\\mathrm { C r } ^ { \\smash { \\breve { \\mathrm { u } } } }$ id) $\\mathbf { M n } ^ { \\mathrm { v } }$ , $\\mathbf { M n } ^ { \\mathrm { u } }$ and $\\bar { \\bf M } \\mathrm { { n } } ^ { \\mathrm { { u } } }$ \n\nmixed oxides \n\nHow would you account for the increasing oxidising power in the Example 4.5 series $\\mathrm { V O _ { 2 } } ^ { + } \\stackrel { - } { < } \\mathrm { C r _ { 2 } O _ { 7 } } ^ { 2 - } < \\mathrm { M n O _ { 4 } } ^ { - } ?$ (cid:) \n\nThis is due to the increasing stability of the lower species to which they Solution are reduced. \n\nIntext Question \n\n4.5 How would you account for the irregular variation of ionisation enthalpies (first and second) in the first series of the transition elements? \n\n4.3.8 Chemical Reactivity and ${ \\bf E } ^ { \\circ }$ (cid:) Values \n\nTransition metals vary widely in their chemical reactivity. Many of them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are 'noble'—that is, they are unaffected by single acids. \n\nThe metals of the first series with the exception of copper are relatively more reactive and are oxidised by $1 \\mathrm { M ~ H ^ { + } }$ ,though the actual rate at which these metals react with oxidising agents like hydrogen ion $\\mathrm { ( H ^ { + } ) }$ is sometimes slow. For example, titanium and vanadium, in practice, are passive to dilute non oxidising acids at room temperature. The $E ^ { \\scriptscriptstyle 0 }$ values for $\\mathbf { M } ^ { 2 + } / \\mathbf { M }$ (Table 4.2) indicate a decreasing tendency to form divalent cations across the series. This general trend towards less negative $E ^ { \\scriptscriptstyle 0 }$ values is related to the increase in the sum of the first and second ionisation enthalpies. It is interesting to note that the $E ^ { \\circ }$ values for Mn, Ni and $Z \\mathrm { n }$ are more negative than expected from the general trend. Whereas the stabilities of half-filled $d$ subshell $( d ^ { 5 } )$ in $\\mathrm { M n } ^ { 2 + }$ and completely filled $d$ subshell $( d ^ { 1 0 } )$ in zinc are related to their $E ^ { \\mathrm { ~ e ~ } }$ values; for nickel, $E ^ { \\mathrm { { ^ { o } } } }$ value is related to the highest negative enthalpy of hydration. \n\nAn examination of the $E ^ { \\scriptscriptstyle 0 }$ yalues for the redox couple $\\mathbf { M } ^ { 3 + } / \\mathbf { M } ^ { 2 + }$ (Table 4.2) shows that $ { \\mathbf { M } }  { \\mathbf { n } } ^ { 3 + }$ and $\\mathrm { C o } ^ { 3 + }$ ions are the strongest oxidising agents $\\mathrm { T i } ^ { 2 + }$ ${ \\mathrm { V } } ^ { 2 + }$ ${ \\mathrm { C r } } ^ { 2 ^ { + } }$ are strong reducing agents and wil liberate hydrogen from a dilute acid, e.g. \n\nExample 4.6 \n\nFor the first row transition metals the $E ^ { \\mathrm { { ^ { o } } } }$ values are: \n\n$\\pmb { \\mathcal { E } } ^ { \\mathrm { { o } } }$ (cid:) V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu $\\boldsymbol { { ( \\mathbf { M } ^ { 2 + } \\mathbf { \\Lambda } / \\mathbf { M } ) } }$ -1.18 - 0.91-1.18- 0.44- 0.28 - 0.25 $+ 0 . 3 4$ \n\nExplain the irregularity in the above values. \n\nSolution \n\nThe $E ^ { \\mathrm { { ^ { o } } } }$ (cid:) $\\boldsymbol { { ( \\mathbf { M } ^ { 2 + } / \\mathbf { M } ) } }$ values are not regular which can be explained from the irregular variation of ionisation enthalpies $\\left( \\Delta _ { \\mathrm { i } } H _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } + \\Delta _ { \\mathrm { i } } H _ { \\mathrm { 2 } } \\right)$ and also the sublimation enthalpies which are relatively much less for manganese and vanadium. \n\nExcample 4.7 \n\nwhy is the $E ^ { \\circ }$ value for the $\\mathrm { M n ^ { 3 + } / M n ^ { 2 + } }$ couple much more positive than that for $\\mathrm { C r } ^ { 3 + } / \\mathrm { C r } ^ { 2 + }$ or $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + } / \\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + } ?$ Explain. \n\nSolution \n\nMuch larger third ionisation energy of Mn (where the required change is $d ^ { 5 }$ to $d ^ { \\bar { 4 } }$ ) is mainly responsible for this. This also explains why the $+ 3$ state of Mn is of little importance. \n\nIntext Questions \n\n4.6 Why is the highest oxidation state of a metal exhibited in its oxide or fluoride only? \n\n4.7 which is a stronger reducing agent ${ \\mathrm { C r } } ^ { 2 + }$ or $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ and why ? \n\n4.3.9 Magnetic Properties \n\nwhen a magnetic field is applied to substances, mainly two types of magnetic behaviour are observed: diamagnetism and paramagnetism. Diamagnetic substances are repelled by the applied field while the paramagnetic substances are attracted. Substances which are attracted very strongly are said to be ferromagnetic. In fact, ferromagnetism is an extreme form of paramagnetism. Many of the transition metal ions are paramagnetic. \n\nParamagnetism arises from the presence of unpaired electrons, each such electron having a magnetic moment associated with its spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum. For the compounds of the first series of transition metals, the contribution of the orbital angular momentum is effectively quenched and hence is of no significance. For these, the magnetic moment is determined by the number of unpaired electrons and is calculated by using the 'spin-only' formula, i.e., \n\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons and  is the magnetic moment in units of Bohr magneton (BM). A single unpaired electron has a magnetic moment of 1.73 Bohr magnetons (BM). \n\nThe magnetic moment increases with the increasing number of unpaired electrons. Thus, the observed magnetic moment gives a useful indication about the number of unpaired electrons present in the atom, molecule or ion. The magnetic moments calculated from the 'spin-only' formula and those derived experimentally for some ions of the first row transition elements are given in Table 4.7. The experimental data are mainly for hydrated ions in solution or in the solid state. \n\nCalculate the magnetic moment of a divalent ion in aqueous solution Example 4.8 if its atomic number is 25. \n\nWith atomic number 25, the divalent ion in aqueous solution will have (cid:) $\\boldsymbol { d } ^ { 5 }$ configuration (five unpaired electrons). The magnetic moment, u is \n\nIntext Question \n\n4.8 Calculate the 'spin only' magnetic moment of $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { M } } ^ { 2 + } { } _ { ( \\mathrm { a q ) } }$ ion $\\left( Z = 2 7 \\right)$ \n\n4.3.10 Formation of Coloured Ions \n\nwhen an electron from a lower energy $d$ orbital is excited to a higher energy $d$ orbital, the energy of excitation corresponds to the frequency of light absorbed (Unit 5). This frequency generally lies in the visible region. The colour observed corresponds to the complementary colour \n\nof the light absorbed. The frequency of the light absorbed is determined by the nature of the ligand. In aqueous solutions where water molecules are the ligands, the colours of the ions observed are listed in Table 4.8. A few coloured solutions of $d \\cdot$ -block elements are illustrated in Fig. 4.5. \n\n4.3.11 Formation of Complex Compounds \n\nComplex compounds are those in which the metal ions bind a number of anions or neutral molecules giving complex species with characteristic properties. A few examples are: $\\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] } ^ { 3 = }$ , $\\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 4 - } }$ , $\\mathrm { [ C u ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 + } }$ and $\\mathrm { [ \\bar { P } t C l _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 - } }$ . (The chemistry of complex compounds is dealt with in detail in Unit 5). The transition metals form a large number of complex compounds. This is due to the comparatively smaller sizes of the metal ions, their high ionic charges and the availability of $d$ orbitals for bond formation. \n\n4.3.12 Catalytic Properties \n\nThe transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple oxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in Contact Process), finely divided iron (in Haber's Process), and nickel (in Catalytic Hydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface involve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms of the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilise $3 d$ and $4 s$ electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening of the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowering). Also because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states, they become more effective as catalysts. For example, iron(lIl) catalyses the reaction between iodide and persulphate ions. \n\nAn explanation of this catalytic action can be given as: \n\n4.3.13 Formation of Interstitial Compounds \n\nInterstitial compounds are those which are formed when small atoms like H, C or N are trapped inside the crystal lattices of metals. They are usually non stoichiometric and are neither typically ionic nor covalent, for example, TiC, $\\mathrm { M n _ { 4 } N }$ $\\mathrm { F e _ { 3 } H }$ , $\\mathrm { V H } _ { 0 ^ { \\cdot } 5 6 }$ and $\\mathrm { T i H } _ { 1 . 7 }$ , etc. The formulas quoted do not, of course, correspond to any normal oxidation state of the metal. Because of the nature of their composition, these compounds are referred to as interstitial compounds. The principal physical and chemical characteristics of these compounds are as follows: \n\n(i) They have high melting points, higher than those of pure metals.   \n(ii) They are very hard, some borides approach diamond in hardness.   \n(ii) They retain metallic conductivity.   \n(iv) They are chemically inert. \n\n4.3.14 Alloy Formation \n\nAn alloy is a blend of metals prepared by mixing the components. Alloys may be homogeneous solid solutions in which the atoms of one metal are distributed randomly among the atoms of the other. Such alloys are formed by atoms with metallic radii that are within about 15 percent of each other. Because of similar radi and other characteristics of transition metals, alloys are readily formed by these metals. The alloys so formed are hard and have often high melting points. The best known are ferrous alloys: chromium, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum and manganese are used for the production of a variety of steels and stainless steel. Alloys of transition metals with non transition metals such as brass (copper-zinc) and bronze (copper-tin), are also of considerable industrial importance. \n\nExample 4.Q what is meant by 'disproportionation' of an oxidation state? Give an example. \n\nSolution When a particular oxidation state becomes less stable relative to other oxidation states, one lower, one higher, it is said to undergo disproportionation. For example, manganese (VIl) becomes unstable relative to manganese(VIl) and manganese (IV) in acidic solution. \n\nIntext Question \n\n4.9 Explain why $\\mathrm { C u } ^ { + }$ ion is not stable in aqueous solutions? \n\n4.4 Some Important Compounds of Transition Elements \n\n4.4.1 Oxides and Oxoanions of Metals \n\nThese oxides are generally formed by the reaction of metals with oxygen at high temperatures. All the metals except scandium form MO oxides which are ionic. The highest oxidation number in the oxides, coincides with the group number and is attained in $\\mathrm { S c } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ to $\\mathbf { M n } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 7 }$ . Beyond group 7, no higher oxides of iron above $\\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ are known. Besides the oxides, the oxocations stabilise $\\mathrm { v ^ { v } }$ as ${ \\mathrm { V O } } _ { 2 } ^ { + }$ , ${ \\mathrm { V } } ^ { \\mathrm { I V } }$ as ${ \\mathrm { V O } } ^ { 2 + }$ and $\\mathrm { T i } ^ { \\mathrm { { I V } } }$ as $\\mathrm { T i O ^ { 2 + } }$ \n\nAs the oxidation number of a metal increases, ionic character decreases. In the case of Mn, $\\bf { M n } _ { 2 } \\bf { O } _ { 7 }$ is a covalent green oil. Even $\\mathrm { C r O } _ { 3 }$ and $\\mathrm { V _ { 2 } O _ { 5 } }$ have low melting points. In these higher oxides, the acidic character is predominant. \n\nThus, $\\mathbf { M n } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 7 }$ gives $\\mathrm { H M n O _ { 4 } }$ and $\\mathrm { C r O } _ { 3 }$ gives $\\mathrm { H _ { 2 } C r O _ { 4 } }$ and $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C r } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 7 }$ . $\\mathrm { V } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 }$ is, however, amphoteric though mainly acidic and it gives $\\mathrm { V O _ { 4 } } ^ { 3 - }$ as wellas $\\mathrm { V O _ { 2 } } ^ { + }$ salts. In vanadium there is gradual change from the basic ${ \\mathrm { V } } _ { 2 } { \\mathrm { O } } _ { 3 }$ to less basic $\\mathrm { V } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ and to amphoteric $\\mathrm { V } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 }$ $\\mathrm { { V _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } } }$ dissolves in acids to give $\\mathrm { V O } ^ { 2 + }$ salts. Similarly, $\\mathrm { V } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 }$ reacts with alkalies as well as acids to give $\\mathrm { V O } _ { 4 } ^ { 3 - }$ and $\\mathrm { V O _ { 4 } ^ { + } }$ respectively. The well characterised $\\mathrm { C r O }$ is basic but $\\mathrm { { C r } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { { O } _ { 3 } } }$ is amphoteric. \n\nPotassium dichromate ${ \\bf K } _ { 2 } { \\bf C } r _ { 2 } { \\bf O } _ { 7 }$ \n\nPotassium dichromate is a very important chemical used in leather industry and as an oxidant for preparation of many azo compounds. Dichromates are generally prepared from chromate, which in turn are obtained by the fusion of chromite ore $\\scriptstyle \\left( \\mathrm { F e C r _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } } \\right)$ with sodium or potassium carbonate in free access of air. The reaction with sodium carbonate occurs as follows: \n\nThe yellow solution of sodium chromate is filtered and acidified with sulphuric acid to give a solution from which orange sodium dichromate, $\\mathrm { N a _ { 2 } C r _ { 2 } O _ { 7 } }$ . $2 \\mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ can be crystallised. \n\nSodium dichromate is more soluble than potassium dichromate. The latter is therefore, prepared by treating the solution of sodium dichromate with potassium chloride. \n\nOrange crystals of potassium dichromate crystallise out. The chromates and dichromates are interconvertible in aqueous solution depending upon $\\mathrm { p H }$ of the solution. The oxidation state of chromium in chromate and dichromate is the same. \n\nThe structures of chromate ion, $\\mathrm { C r O } _ { 4 } ^ { 2 - }$ and the dichromate ion, $\\mathrm { { C r } _ { 2 } { O _ { 7 } } ^ { 2 - } }$ are shown below. The chromate ion is tetrahedral whereas the dichromate ion consists of two tetrahedra sharing one corner with Cr-O-Cr bond angle of $1 2 6 ^ { \\circ }$ . \n\nSodium and potassium dichromates are strong oxidising agents; the sodium salt has a greater solubility in water and is extensively used as an oxidising agent in organic chemistry. Potassium dichromate is used as a primary standard in volumetric analysis. In acidic solution, its oxidising action can be represented as follows: \n\nThus, acidified potassium dichromate will oxidise iodides to iodine, sulphides to sulphur, tin(II) to tin(IV) and iron(II) salts to iron(II). The half-reactions are noted below: \n\nThe full ionic equation may be obtained by adding the half-reaction for potassium dichromate to the half-reaction for the reducing agent, for e.g., \n\nPotassium permanganate $\\bf K M n O _ { 4 }$ \n\nPotassium permanganate is prepared by fusion of $\\mathbf { M n O } _ { 2 }$ with an alkali metal hydroxide and an oxidising agent like $\\mathrm { K N O } _ { 3 }$ . This produces the dark green $\\mathrm { K _ { 2 } M n O _ { 4 } }$ which disproportionates in a neutral or acidic solution to give permanganate. \n\nCommercially it is prepared by the alkaline oxidative fusion of $\\mathbf { M n O _ { 2 } }$ followed by the electrolytic oxidation of manganate (V). \n\nIn the laboratory, a manganese (Il) ion salt is oxidised by peroxodisulphate to permanganate. \n\nPotassium permanganate forms dark purple (almost black) crystals which are isostructural with those of $\\mathrm { K C l O _ { 4 } }$ . The salt is not very soluble in water $( 6 . 4 \\ : \\mathrm { g } / 1 0 0 \\ : \\mathrm { g }$ of water at 293 K), but when heated it decomposes at $5 1 3 \\ \\mathrm { K }$ (cid:) \n\n0   \nMn 0 \n\nTetrahedral manganate ion (green) \n\nIt has two physical properties of considerable interest: its intense colour and its diamagnetism along with temperature-dependent weak paramagnetism. These can be explained by the use of molecular orbital theory which is beyond the present scope. \n\nThe manganate and permanganate ions are tetrahedral; the $\\pi$ - bonding takes place by overlap of $p$ orbitals of oxygen with $d$ orbitals of manganese. The green manganate is paramagnetic because of one unpaired electron but the permanganate is diamagnetic due to the absence of unpaired electron. \n\nAcidified permanganate solution oxidises oxalates to carbon dioxide, iron(Il) to iron(Ill), nitrites to nitrates and iodides to free iodine. The half-reactions of reductants are: \n\nTetrahedral permanganate ion (purple) \n\nThe full reaction can be written by adding the half-reaction for ${ \\mathrm { K M n O } } _ { 4 }$ to the half-reaction of the reducing agent, balancing wherever necessary. \n\nIf we represent the reduction of permanganate to manganate, manganese dioxide and manganese(Il) salt by half-reactions, \n\nWe can very well see that the hydrogen ion concentration of the solution plays an important part in influencing the reaction. Although many reactions can be understood by consideration of redox potential, kinetics of the reaction is also an important factor. Permanganate at $[ \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } ] = 1$ should oxidise water but in practice the reaction is extremely slow unless either manganese(l) ions are present or the temperature is raised. \n\nA few important oxidising reactions of $\\mathrm { K M n O _ { 4 } }$ are given below: \n\n1. In acid solutions: \n\n(a) Iodine is liberated from potassium iodide : $1 0 \\mathrm { I ^ { - } } + 2 \\mathrm { M n O _ { 4 } } ^ { - } + 1 6 \\mathrm { H ^ { + } }  2 \\mathrm { M n } ^ { 2 + } + 8 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } + 5 \\mathrm { I } _ { 2 }$   \n(b) $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ ion (green) is converted to $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }$ (yellow): $5 \\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + } + \\mathrm { M n O } _ { 4 } ^ { - } + 8 \\mathrm { H } ^ { + }  \\mathrm { M n } ^ { 2 + } + 4 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } + 5 \\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }$   \n(c) Oxalate ion or oxalic acid is oxidised at 333 K: (cid:) $5 \\mathrm { C _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } } ^ { 2 - } + 2 \\mathrm { M n O _ { 4 } } ^ { - } + 1 6 \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm { M n } ^ { 2 + } + 8 \\mathrm { H _ { 2 } O } + 1 0 \\mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$   \n(d) Hydrogen sulphide is oxidised, sulphur being precipitated: $\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S } \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } + \\mathrm { S } ^ { 2 - } } \\\\ & { 5 \\mathrm { S } ^ { 2 - } + 2 \\mathrm { M n O } _ { 4 } ^ { - } + 1 6 \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm { M n } ^ { 2 + } + 8 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } + 5 \\mathrm { S } } \\end{array}$   \n(e) Sulphurous acid or sulphite is oxidised to a sulphate or sulphuric acid: (cid:) $5 \\mathrm { S O _ { 3 } } ^ { 2 - } + 2 \\mathrm { M n O _ { 4 } } ^ { - } + 6 \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm { M n } ^ { 2 + } + 3 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } + 5 \\mathrm { S O _ { 4 } } ^ { 2 - }$   \n(f) Nitrite is oxidised to nitrate: $5 \\mathrm { N O _ { 2 } } ^ { - } + 2 \\mathrm { M n O _ { 4 } } ^ { - } + 6 \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } \\mathrm { ~ \\longrightarrow ~ } 2 \\mathrm { M n } ^ { 2 + } + 5 \\mathrm { N O _ { 3 } } ^ { - } + 3 \\mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ \n\n2. In neutral or faintly alkaline solutions: \n\n(a) A notable reaction is the oxidation of iodide to iodate: $2 \\mathrm { M n O } _ { 4 } ^ { - } + \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } + \\Gamma \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm { M n O } _ { 2 } + 2 \\mathrm { O H } ^ { - } + \\mathrm { I O } _ { 3 } ^ { - }$   \n(b) Thiosulphate is oxidised almost quantitatively to sulphate: $8 \\mathrm { M n O _ { 4 } ^ { - } } + 3 \\mathrm { S _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } ^ { - 2 - } } + \\mathrm { H _ { 2 } O } \\mathrm { \\longrightarrow } \\mathrm { 8 M n O _ { 2 } } + 6 \\mathrm { S O _ { 4 } ^ { - 2 - } } + 2 \\mathrm { O H } ^ { - 4 - }$   \n(c) Manganous salt is oxidised to $\\mathbf { M n O } _ { 2 }$ ; the presence of zinc sulphate or zinc oxide catalyses the oxidation: $2 \\mathrm { M n O } _ { 4 } ^ { - } + 3 \\mathrm { M n } ^ { 2 + } + 2 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } \\longrightarrow 5 \\mathrm { M n O } _ { 2 } + 4 \\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ \n\nNote: Permanganate titrations in presence of hydrochloric acid are unsatisfactory since hydrochloric acid is oxidised to chlorine. \n\nUses: Besides its use in analytical chemistry, potassium permanganate is used as a favourite oxidant in preparative organic chemistry. Its uses for the bleaching of wool, cotton, silk and other textile fibres and for the decolourisation of oils are also dependent on its strong oxidising power. \n\nTHE INNER TRANSITIoN ELEMENTS (f-BLOCK) \n\nThe f-block consists of the two series, lanthanoids (the fourteen elements following lanthanum) and actinoids (the fourteen elements following actinium). Because lanthanum closely resembles the lanthanoids, it is usually included in any discussion of the lanthanoids for which the general symbol Ln is often used. Similarly, a discussion of the actinoids includes actinium besides the fourteen elements constituting the series. The lanthanoids resemble one another more closely than do the members of ordinary transition elements in any series. They have only one stable oxidation state and their chemistry provides an excellent opportunity to examine the effect of small changes in size and nuclear charge along a series of otherwise similar elements. The chemistry of the actinoids is, on the other hand, much more complicated. The complication arises partly owing to the occurrence of a wide range of oxidation states in these elements and partly because their radioactivity creates special problems in their study; the two series will be considered separately here. \n\nThe names, symbols, electronic configurations of atomic and some ionic states and atomic and ionic radii of lanthanum and lanthanoids (for which the general symbol Ln is used) are given in Table 4.9. \n\n4.5.1 Electronic Configurations \n\nIt may be noted that atoms of these elements have electronic configuration with $6 s ^ { 2 }$ common but with variable occupancy of $4 f$ level (Table 4.9). However, the electronic configurations of all the tripositive ions (the most stable oxidation state of all the lanthanoids) are of the form $4 f ^ { \\mathrm { n } }$ (cid:) $( \\mathbf { n } = \\mathbf { \\bar { \\rho } } _ { 1 }$ to 14 with increasing atomic number). \n\n4.5.2 Atomic and Ionic Sizes \n\nThe overall decrease in atomic and ionic radii from lanthanum to lutetium (the lanthanoid contraction) is a unique feature in the chemistry of the lanthanoids. It has far reaching consequences in the chemistry of the third transition series of the elements. The decrease in atomic radii (derived from the structures of metals) is not quite regular as it is regular in $\\mathbf { M } ^ { 3 + }$ ions (Fig. 4.6). This contraction is, of course, similar to that observed in an ordinary transition series and is attributed to the same cause, the imperfect shielding of one electron by another in the same sub-shell. However, the shielding of one $4 f$ electron by another is less than one $d$ electron by another with the increase in nuclear charge along the series. There is fairly regular decrease in the sizes with increasing atomic number. \n\nThe cumulative effect of the contraction of the lanthanoid series, known as lanthanoid contraction, causes the radii of the members of the third transition series to be very similar to those of the corresponding members of the second series. The almost identical radii of $Z \\mathrm { r }$ $( 1 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { p m } )$ and Hf $\\left( 1 5 9 \\ \\mathrm { p m } \\right)$ , a consequence of the lanthanoid contraction, account for their occurrence together in nature and for the difficulty faced in their separation. \n\n4.5.3 Oxidation States \n\nIn the lanthanoids, La(Il) and $\\operatorname { L n } ( \\operatorname { I I I } )$ compounds are predominant species. However, occasionally $+ 2$ and $+ 4$ ions in solution or in solid compounds are also obtained. This irregularity (as in ionisation enthalpies) arises mainly from the extra stability of empty, half-filled or filled $f$ subshell. Thus, the formation of $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { \\mathrm { \\bar { \\mathrm { { I v } } } } }$ is favoured by its noble gas configuration, but it is a strong oxidant reverting to the common $+ 3$ state. The $E ^ { \\circ }$ value for $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 4 + } / \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ is $+ \\ 1 . 7 4 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ which suggests that it can oxidise water. However, the reaction rate is very slow and hence $\\mathrm { C e ( I V ) }$ is a good analytical reagent. Pr, Nd, Tb and Dy also exhibit $+ 4$ state but only in oxides, $\\mathbf { M O } _ { 2 }$ . $\\bar { \\mathrm { E } } \\mathrm { u } ^ { 2 + }$ is formed by losing the two s electrons and its $f ^ { \\bar { 7 } }$ configuration accounts for the formation of this ion. However, ${ \\mathrm { E u } } ^ { 2 + }$ is a strong reducing agent changing to the common $+ 3$ state. Similarly ${ \\mathrm { Y b } } ^ { 2 + }$ which has $\\dot { \\boldsymbol { f } } ^ { \\intercal 4 }$ configuration is a reductant. $\\mathrm { T b } ^ { \\mathrm { I V } }$ has half-filled $f$ orbitals and is an oxidant. The behaviour of samarium is very much like europium, exhibiting both $+ 2$ and $+ 3$ oxidation states. \n\n4.5.4 General Characteristics \n\nAll the lanthanoids are silvery white soft metals and tarnish rapidly in air. The hardness increases with increasing atomic number, samarium being steel hard. Their melting points range between 1000 to 1200 K but samarium melts at 1623 K. They have typical metallic structure and are good conductors of heat and electricity. Density and other properties change smoothly except for Eu and Yb and occasionally for Sm and Tm. \n\nMany trivalent lanthanoid ions are coloured both in the solid state and in aqueous solutions. Colour of these ions may be attributed to the presence of $f$ electrons. Neither ${ \\mathrm { L a } } ^ { 3 + }$ nor ${ \\mathrm { L u } } ^ { 3 + }$ ion shows any colour but the rest do so. However, absorption bands are narrow, probably because of the excitation within $f$ level. The lanthanoid ions other than the $f ^ { \\circ }$ type $\\mathrm { { ( L a } ^ { 3 + } }$ and $\\mathrm { C e ^ { 4 + } } ]$ and he $f ^ { 1 4 }$ type $\\mathrm { ( Y b ) ^ { 2 + } }$ and ${ \\mathrm { L u } } ^ { 3 + }$ are all paramagnetic. \n\nThe first ionisation enthalpies of the lanthanoids are around $6 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { k J \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ , the second about $1 2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { k J \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ comparable with those of calcium. A detailed discussion of the variation of the third ionisation enthalpies indicates that the exchange enthalpy considerations (as in $3 d$ orbitals of the first transition series), appear to impart a certain degree of stability to empty, half-filled and completely filled orbitals $f$ level. This is indicated from the abnormally low value of the third ionisation enthalpy of lanthanum, gadolinium and lutetium. \n\nIn their chemical behaviour, in general, the earlier members of the series are quite reactive similar to calcium but, with increasing atomic number, they behave more like aluminium. Values for $E ^ { \\circ }$ for the half-reaction: \n\nare in the range of $- 2 . 2$ to $- 2 . 4 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ except for Eu for which the value is $- 2 . 0 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ . This is, of course, a small variation. The metals combine with hydrogen when gently heated in the gas. The carbides, $\\mathrm { L n } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ , $\\mathrm { L n } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ and $\\mathrm { L n C _ { 2 } }$ are formed when the metals are heated with carbon. They liberate hydrogen from dilute acids and burn in halogens to form halides. They form oxides $\\mathbf { M } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ and hydroxides $\\mathrm { { \\bf M } ( O H ) _ { 3 } }$ . The hydroxides are definite compounds, not just hydrated oxides. They are basic like alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides. Their general reactions are depicted in Fig. 4.7. \n\nThe best single use of the lanthanoids is for the production of alloy steels for plates and pipes. A well known alloy is mischmetall which consists of a lanthanoid metal $( \\sim 9 5 \\% )$ and iron $\\left( \\sim 5 \\% \\right)$ and traces of S, C, Ca and Al. A good deal of mischmetall is used in $\\mathbf { M } \\mathbf { g } ^ { \\mathbf { \\alpha } }$ -based alloy to produce bullets, shell and lighter flint. Mixed oxides of lanthanoids are employed as catalysts in petroleum cracking. Some individual Ln oxides are used as phosphors in television screens and similar fluorescing surfaces. \n\n4.6 The Actinoids \n\nThe actinoids include the fourteen elements from Th to Lr. The names, symbols and some properties of these elements are given in Table 4.10. \n\nThe actinoids are radioactive elements and the earlier members have relatively long half-lives, the latter ones have half-life values ranging from a day to 3 minutes for lawrencium $\\scriptstyle [ Z = 1 0 3 ]$ . The latter members could be prepared only in nanogram quantities. These facts render their study more difficult. \n\n4.6.1 Electronic Configurations \n\nAll the actinoids are believed to have the electronic configuration of $7 \\mathrm { { s } ^ { 2 } }$ and variable occupancy of the 5f and 6d subshells. The fourteen electrons are formally added to $5 f ,$ though not in thorium $( Z = 9 0 )$ but from Pa onwards the $5 f$ orbitals are complete at element 103. The irregularities in the electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids are related to the stabilities of the $f ^ { 0 } , f ^ { 7 }$ and $f ^ { 1 4 }$ occupancies of the 5f orbitals. Thus, the configurations of Am and $\\mathrm { C m }$ are [Rn] $5 f ^ { 7 } 7 s ^ { 2 }$ and [Rn] $5 f ^ { 7 } 6 d ^ { 1 } 7 s ^ { 2 }$ . Although the $5 f$ orbitals resemble the $4 f$ orbitals in their angular part of the wave-function, they are not as buried as $4 f$ orbitals and hence 5f electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent. \n\n4.6.2 Ionic Sizes \n\nThe general trend in lanthanoids is observable in the actinoids as well. There is a gradual decrease in the size of atoms or $\\mathbf { M } ^ { 3 + }$ ions across the series. This may be referred to as the actinoid contraction like lanthanoid contraction). The contraction is, however, greater from element to element in this series resulting from poor shielding by $5 f$ electrons. \n\n4.6.3 Oxidation States \n\nThere is a greater range of oxidation states, which is in part attributed to the fact that the 5f, 6d and 7s levels are of comparable energies. The known oxidation states of actinoids are listed in Table 4.11. \n\nThe actinoids show in general $+ 3$ oxidation state. The elements, in the first half of the series frequently exhibit higher oxidation states. For example, the maximum oxidation state increases from $+ 4$ in Th to $+ 5$ , $+ 6$ and $+ 7$ respectively in Pa, U and Np but decreases in succeeding elements (Table 4.1 1). The actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in having more compounds in $+ 3$ state than in the $+ 4$ state. However, $+ 3$ and $+ 4$ ions tend to hydrolyse. Because the distribution of oxidation states among the actinoids is so uneven and so different for the former and later elements, it is unsatisfactory to review their chemistry in terms of oxidation states. \n\n4.6.4 General Characteristics and Comparison with Lanthanoids \n\nThe actinoid metals are all silvery in appearance but display a variety of structures. The structural variability is obtained due to irregularities in metallic radi which are far greater than in lanthanoids. \n\nThe actinoids are highly reactive metals, especially when finely divided. The action of boiling water on them, for example, gives a mixture of oxide and hydride and combination with most non metals takes place at moderate temperatures. Hydrochloric acid attacks all metals but most are slightly affected by nitric acid owing to the formation of protective oxide layers; alkalies have no action. \n\nThe magnetic properties of the actinoids are more complex than those of the lanthanoids. Although the variation in the magnetic susceptibility of the actinoids with the number of unpaired 5 $f$ electrons is roughly parallel to the corresponding results for the lanthanoids, the latter have higher values. \n\nIt is evident from the behaviour of the actinoids that the ionisation enthalpies of the early actinoids, though not accurately known, but are lower than for the early lanthanoids. This is quite reasonable since it is to be expected that when 5f orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will penetrate less into the inner core of electrons. The 5f electrons, will therefore, be more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge than the $4 f$ electrons of the corresponding lanthanoids. Because the outer electrons are less firmly held, they are available for bonding in the actinoids. \n\nA comparison of the actinoids with the lanthanoids, with respect to different characteristics as discussed above, reveals that behaviour similar to that of the lanthanoids is not evident until the second half of the actinoid series. However, even the early actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in showing close similarities with each other and in gradual variation in properties which do not entail change in oxidation state. The lanthanoid and actinoid contractions, have extended effects on the sizes, and therefore, the properties of the elements succeeding them in their respective periods. The lanthanoid contraction is more important because the chemistry of elements succeeding the actinoids are much less known at the present time. \n\nExample 4.10 Name a member of the lanthanoid series which is well known to exhibit $+ 4$ oxidation state.   \nSolution Cerium $( Z = 5 8 )$ \n\nIntexct Question \n\n4.10 Actinoid contraction is greater from element to element than lanthanoid contraction. why? \n\n4.7 SomeApplicationsof d- andf-BlockElements\n\nIron and steels are the most important construction materials. Their production is based on the reduction of iron oxides, the removal of impurities and the addition of carbon and alloying metals such as Cr, Mn and Ni. Some compounds are manufactured for special purposes such as TiO for the pigment industry and $\\mathbf { M n O } _ { 2 }$ for use in dry battery cells. The battery industry also requires $Z \\mathrm { n }$ and Ni/Cd. The elements of Group 11 are still worthy of being called the coinage metals, although Ag and Au are restricted to collection items and the contemporary UK 'copper' coins are copper-coated steel. The 'silver' UK coins are a Cu/Ni alloy. Many of the metals and/or their compounds are essential catalysts in the chemical industry. $\\mathrm { V } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 }$ catalyses the oxidation of $\\mathrm { S O } _ { 2 }$ in the manufacture of sulphuric acid. $\\mathrm { T i C l } _ { 4 }$ with $\\mathrm { { A 1 } ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } }$ forms the basis of the Ziegler catalysts used to manufacture polyethylene (polythene). Iron catalysts are used in the Haber process for the production of ammonia from $\\mathrm { { N _ { 2 } / H _ { 2 } } }$ mixtures. Nickel catalysts enable the hydrogenation of fats to proceed. In the Wacker process the oxidation of ethyne to ethanal is catalysed by $\\mathrm { P d C l } _ { 2 }$ . Nickel complexes are useful in the polymerisation of alkynes and other organic compounds such as benzene. The photographic industry relies on the special light-sensitive properties of AgBr. \n\nThe d-block consisting of Groups 3-12 occupies the large middle section of the periodic table. In these elements the inner $d$ orbitals are progressively filled. The f-block is placed outside at the bottom of the periodic table and in the elements of this block, $4 f$ and $5 f$ orbitals are progressively filled. \n\nCorresponding to the filling of $3 d$ i:) $4 d$ and $5 d$ orbitals, three series of transition elements are well recognised. All the transition elements exhibit typical metallic properties such as -high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, thermal and electrical conductivity and metallic character. Their melting and boiling points are high which are attributed to the involvement of $( n { - } 1 ) d$ electrons resulting into strong interatomic bonding. In many of these properties, the maxima occur at about the middle of each series which indicates that one unpaired electron per $d$ orbital is particularly a favourable configuration for strong interatomic interaction. \n\nSuccessive ionisation enthalpies do not increase as steeply as in the main group elements with increasing atomic number Hence, the loss of variable number of electrons from $( n { - } 1 ) d$ orbitals is not energetically unfavourable. The involvement of (n–1) d electrons in the behaviour of transition elements impart certain distinct characteristics to these elements. Thus, in addition to variable oxidation states, they exhibit paramagnetic behaviour, catalytic properties and tendency for the formation of coloured ions, interstitial compounds and complexes. \n\nThe transition elements vary widely in their chemical behaviour. Many of them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are 'noble'. Of the first series, with the exception of copper, all the metals are relatively reactive. \n\nThe transition metals react with a number of non-metals like oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and halogens to form binary compounds. The first series transition metal oxides are generally formed from the reaction of metals with oxygen at high temperatures. These oxides dissolve in acids and bases to form oxometalic salts. Potassium dichromate and potassium permanganate are common examples. Potassium dichromate is prepared from the chromite ore by fusion with alkali in presence of air and acidifying the extract. Pyrolusite ore $\\mathrm { { ( M n O _ { 2 } ) } }$ is used for the preparation of potassium permanganate. Both the dichromate and the permanganate ions are strong oxidising agents. \n\nThe two series of inner transition elements, lanthanoids and actinoids constitute the fblock of the periodic table. with the successive filling of the inner orbitals, $4 f ,$ there is a gradual decrease in the atomic and ionic sizes of these metals along the series (lanthanoid contraction). This has far reaching consequences in the chemistry of the elements succeeding them. Lanthanum and all the lanthanoids are rather soft white metals. They react easily with water to give solutions giving $+ 3$ ions. The principal oxidation state is $+ 3$ although $+ 4$ and $+ 2$ oxidation states are also exhibited by some occasionally. The chemistry of the actinoids is more complex in view of their ability to exist in different oxidation states. Furthermore, many of the actinoid elements are radioactive which make the study of these elements rather difficult. \n\nThere are many useful applications of the $d \\cdot$ and $f$ block elements and their compounds, notable among them being in varieties of steels, catalysts, complexes, organic syntheses, etc. \n\nExercises \n\n4.1 Write down the electronic configuration of: \n\n(i) $\\mathrm { C r ^ { 3 + } }$ (cid:) (ii) $\\operatorname { C u } ^ { + }$ (v) $\\mathrm { C o ^ { 2 } + }$ (cid:) (vii) Mn2+ (ii) $\\mathrm { P m } ^ { 3 + }$ (cid:) (iv) ${ \\mathrm { C e } } ^ { 4 + }$ (cid:) (vi) ${ \\mathrm { L u } } ^ { 2 + }$ (cid:) (viii) Th4+ \n\n4.2 Why are $\\mathrm { M n ^ { 2 + } }$ compounds more stable than $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ towards oxidation to their (cid:) $+ 3$ state? \n\n4.3 Explain briefly how $+ 2$ state becomes more and more stable in the first half of the first row transition elements with increasing atomic number? \n\n4.4 To what extent do the electronic configurations decide the stability of oxidation states in the first series of the transition elements?

    "content": "Objctives \n\nAfter studying this Unit, you will be able to \n\nappreciate the postulates of Werner's theory of coordination compounds; know the meaning of the terms: coordination entity, central atom/ ion, ligand, coordination number, coordination sphere, coordination polyhedron, oxidation number, homoleptic and heteroleptic; learn the rules of nomenclature of coordination compounds; write the formulas and names of mononuclear coordination compounds; - define different types of isomerism in coordination compounds; understand the nature of bonding in coordination compounds in terms of the Valence Bond and Crystal Field theories; appreciate the importance and applications of coordination compounds in our day to day life. \n\nCoordination Compounds are the backbone of modern inorganic and bio-inorganic chemistry and chemical industry. \n\nIn the previous Unit we learnt that the transition metals form a large number of complex compounds in which the metal atoms are bound to a number of anions or neutral molecules by sharing of electrons. In modern terminology such compounds are called coordination compounds. The chemistry of coordination compounds is an important and challenging area of modern inorganic chemistry. New concepts of chemical bonding and molecular structure have provided insights into the functioning of these compounds as vital components of biological systems. Chlorophyl, haemoglobin and vitamin $\\mathrm { { B } } _ { 1 2 }$ are coordination compounds of magnesium, iron and cobalt respectively. Variety of metallurgical processes, industrial catalysts and analytical reagents involve the use of coordination compounds. Coordination compounds also find many applications in electroplating, textile dyeing and medicinal chemistry. \n\n5.1 Werner's Theory of Coordination Compounds \n\nAlfred werner (1866-1919), a Swiss chemist was the first to formulate his ideas about the structures of coordination compounds. He prepared and characterised a large number of coordination compounds and studied their physical and chemical behaviour by simple experimental techniques. Werner proposed the concept of a primary valence and a secondary valence for a metal ion. Binary compounds such as $\\mathrm { C r C l } _ { 3 }$ , $\\mathrm { C o C l } _ { 2 }$ or $\\mathrm { P d C l } _ { 2 }$ have primary valence of 3, 2 and 2 respectively. In a series of compounds of cobalt(ll) chloride with ammonia, it was found that some of the chloride ions could be precipitated as AgCl on adding excess silver nitrate solution in cold but some remained in solution. \n\n1mol (cid:) $\\mathrm { C o C l _ { 3 } . 6 N H _ { 3 } }$ (Yellow) gave 3 mol AgC1   \n1 mol CoCl3.5NH3 (Purple) gave 2 mol AgCl   \n1 mol CoCl3.4NH3 (Green) gave 1 mol AgCl   \n1 mol CoCl3.4NH3 (Violet) gave 1 mol AgCl \n\nThese observations, together with the results of conductivity measurements in solution can be explained if (i) six groups in all, either chloride ions or ammonia molecules or both, remain bonded to the cobalt ion during the reaction and (i) the compounds are formulated as shown in Table 5.1, where the atoms within the square brackets form a single entity which does not dissociate under the reaction conditions. Werner proposed the term secondary valence for the number of groups bound directly to the metal ion; in each of these examples the secondary valences are six. - \n\nNote that the last two compounds in Table 5.1 have identical empirical formula, $\\mathrm { C o C l _ { 3 } . 4 N H _ { 3 } }$ , but distinct properties. Such compounds are termed as isomers. Werner in 1898, propounded his theory of coordination compounds. The main postulates are: \n\n1. In coordination compounds metals show two types of linkages (valences)-primary and secondary.   \n2. The primary valences are normally ionisable and are satisfied by negative ions.   \n3. The secondary valences are non ionisable. These are satisfied by neutral molecules or negative ions. The secondary valence is equal to the coordination number and is fixed for a metal.   \n4. The ions/groups bound by the secondary linkages to the metal have characteristic spatial arrangements corresponding to different coordination numbers. \n\n$\\operatorname { I n }$ modern formulations, such spatial arrangements are called coordination polyhedra. The species within the square bracket are coordination entities or complexes and the ions outside the square bracket are called counter ions. \n\nHe further postulated that octahedral, tetrahedral and square planar geometrical shapes are more common in coordination compounds of transition metals. Thus, $\\mathrm { \\left[ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } \\right] ^ { 3 + } }$ , $\\mathrm { [ C o C l ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } ] ^ { 2 + } }$ and $\\mathrm { { [ C o \\bar { C } l _ { 2 } ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 4 } ] } ^ { + } }$ are octahedral entities, while $\\mathrm { [ N i ( C O ) _ { 4 } ] }$ and $\\mathrm { [ P t C l _ { 4 } ] } ^ { 2 - }$ are tetrahedral and square planar, respectively. \n\nOn the basis of the following observations made with aqueous solutions, Example 5.1 assign secondary valences to metals in the following compounds: \n\n(i) Secondary 4 (ii) Secondary 6 Solution (ii) Secondary 6 (iv) Secondary 6 (v) Secondary 4 \n\nDifference between a double salt and a complex \n\nBoth double salts as well as complexes are formed by the combination of two or more stable compounds in stoichiometric ratio. However, they differ in the fact that double salts such as carnallite, $\\mathrm { K C l . M g C l _ { 2 } . 6 H _ { 2 } O }$ , Mohr's salt, $\\mathrm { F e S O _ { 4 } }$ . $\\mathrm { ( N H _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } S O _ { 4 } } . 6 \\mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ , potash alum, $\\mathrm { K A l } ( \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } . 1 2 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ etc. dissociate into simple ions completely when dissolved in water. However, complex ions such as $\\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 4 - } }$ of $\\mathrm { K _ { 4 } } \\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] }$ do not dissociate into $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ and CN ions. \n\nWermer was born on December 12, 1866, in Mülhouse, a small community in the French province of Alsace. His study of chemistry began in Karlsruhe (Germany) and continued in Zurich (Switzerland), where in his doctoral thesis in l890, he explained the difference in properties of certain nitrogen containing organic substances on the basis of isomerism. He extended vant Hoff's theory of tetrahedral carbon atom and modified it for nitrogen. werner showed optical and electrical differences between complex compounds based on physical measurements. In fact, Werner was the first to discover optical activity in certain coordination compounds. \n\nHe, at the age of 29 years became a full professor at Technische Hochschule in Zurich in 1895. Alfred Werner was a chemist and educationist. His accomplishments included the development of the theory of coordination compounds. This theory, in which Werner proposed revolutionary ideas about how atoms and molecules are linked together, was formulated in a span of only three years, from 1890 to 1893. The remainder of his career was spent gathering the experimental support required to validate his new ideas. Werner became the first Swiss chemist to win the Nobel Prize in 1913 for his work on the linkage of atoms and the coordination theory. \n\n5.2 Definitions of Some Important Terms Pertaining to Coordination Compounds (a) Coordination entity \n\nA coordination entity constitutes a central metal atom or ion bonded to a fixed number of ions or molecules. For example, $\\mathrm { [ C o C l _ { 3 } ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } ] }$ is a coordination entity in which the cobalt ion is surrounded by three ammonia molecules and three chloride ions. Other examples are $\\mathrm { [ N i ( C O ) _ { 4 } ] }$ , $\\mathrm { [ P t C l _ { 2 } ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } ] }$ , $\\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 4 - } }$ , $\\mathrm { \\left[ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } \\right] ^ { 3 + } }$ . \n\n(b) Central atom/ion \n\nIn a coordination entity, the atom/ion to which a fixed number of ions/groups are bound in a definite geometrical arrangement around it, is called the central atom or ion. For example, the central atom/ion in the coordination entities: $\\mathrm { [ N i C l _ { 2 } ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 4 } ] }$ , $\\mathrm { \\small { [ C o C l ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } ] } ^ { 2 + } }$ and $\\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ are $\\mathrm { N i } ^ { 2 + }$ $\\mathrm { C o } ^ { 3 + }$ and $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }$ , respectively. These central atoms/ions are also referred to as Lewis acids. \n\n(c) Ligands \n\nCH2COO   \nH₂C—N CH2COOCH2COO  \nH₂C—N CH2COO\n\nThe ions or molecules bound to the central atom/ion in the coordination entity are called ligands. These may be simple ions such as $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ , small molecules such as $_ \\mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ or $\\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }$ , larger molecules such as $\\mathrm { H _ { 2 } N C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 2 } N H _ { 2 } }$ or $\\mathrm { { N } ( C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 2 } N H _ { 2 } ) _ { 3 } }$ or even macromolecules, such as proteins. \n\nWhen a ligand is bound to a metal ion through a single donor atom, as with $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ , $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ or $\\mathrm { N H _ { 3 } }$ , the ligand is said to be unidentate. \n\nWhen a ligand can bind through two donor atoms as in $\\mathrm { H _ { 2 } N C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 2 } N H _ { 2 } }$ (ethane-1,2-diamine) or $\\mathrm { { C _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } } ^ { 2 - } }$ (oxalate), the ligand is said to be didentate and when several donor atoms are present in a single ligand as in $\\mathrm { { N } ( C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 2 } N H _ { 2 } ) _ { 3 } }$ , the ligand is said to be polydentate. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion $\\mathrm { ( E D T A ^ { 4 - } ) }$ is an important hexadentate ligand. It can bind through two nitrogen and four oxygen atoms to a central metal ion. \n\nWhen a di- or polydentate ligand uses its two or more donor atoms simultaneously to bind a single metal ion, it is said to be a chelate ligand. The number of such ligating groups is called the denticity of the ligand. Such complexes, called chelate complexes tend to be more stable than similar complexes containing unidentate ligands. Ligand which has two different donor atoms and either of \n\nnitrito-N \n\n$\\mathrm { M } \\longleftarrow \\mathrm { S C N }$ M←NCS thiocyanato-S thiocyanato-N the two ligetes in the complex is called ambidentate ligand. Examples of such ligands are the $\\mathrm { N O } _ { 2 } ^ { - }$ and SCN ions. $\\mathrm { N O } _ { 2 } ^ { - }$ ion can coordinate either through nitrogen or through oxygen to a central metal atom/ion. \n\nnitrito-O \n\nSimilarly, SCN ion can coordinate through the sulphur or nitrogen atom. \n\n(d) Coordination number \n\nThe coordination number (CN) of a metal ion in a complex can be defined as the number of ligand donor atoms to which the metal is directly bonded. For example, in the complex ions, $\\mathrm { [ P t C l _ { 6 } ] } ^ { 2 - }$ and $\\mathrm { [ N i ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 + } }$ , the coordination number of $\\mathrm { P t }$ and $\\mathbf { N i }$ are 6 and 4 respectively. Similarly, in the complex ions, $\\mathrm { | F e ( C _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } ) _ { 3 } | ^ { 3 - } }$ and $\\mathrm { [ C o ( e n ) _ { 3 } ] ^ { 3 + } }$ , the coordination number of both, Fe and $\\mathbf { C o }$ , is 6 because $\\mathrm { { C _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } } ^ { 2 - } }$ and en (ethane-1,2-diamine) are didentate ligands. \n\nIt is important to note here that coordination number of the central atom/ion is determined only by the number of sigma bonds formed by the ligand with the central atom/ion. Pi bonds, if formed between the ligand and the central atom/ion, are not counted for this purpose. \n\n(e) Coordination sphere \n\nThe central atom/ion and the ligands attached to it are enclosed in square bracket and is collectively termed as the coordination sphere. The ionisable groups are written outside the bracket and are called counter ions. For example, in the complex $\\mathrm { K _ { 4 } [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] }$ , the coordination sphere is $\\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 4 - } }$ and the counter ion is $\\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ . \n\n(f) Coordination polyhedron \n\nThe spatial arrangement of the ligand atoms which are directly attached to the central atom/ion defines a coordination polyhedron about the central atom. The most common coordination polyhedra are octahedral, square planar and tetrahedral. For example, $\\mathrm { \\left[ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } \\right] ^ { 3 + } }$ is octahedral, $\\mathrm { [ N i ( C O ) _ { 4 } ] }$ is tetrahedral and $\\mathrm { [ P t C l _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 - } }$ is square planar. Fig. 5.1 shows the shapes of different coordination polyhedra. \n\n(g) Oxidation number of central atom The oxidation number of the central atom in a complex is defined as the charge it would carry if all the ligands are removed along with the electron pairs that are shared with the central atom. The oxidation number is represented by a Roman numeral in parenthesis following the name of the coordination entity. For example, oxidation number of copper in $\\mathrm { \\Delta [ C u ( C N ) _ { 4 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ is $+ 1$ and it is written as $\\mathrm { C u ( I ) }$ .   \n(h) Homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes Complexes in which a metal is bound to only one kind of donor groups, e.g., $\\mathrm { \\left[ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } \\right] ^ { 3 + } }$ , are known as homoleptic. Complexes in which a metal is bound to more than one kind of donor groups, e.g., $\\mathrm { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 4 } C l _ { 2 } l ^ { + } }$ , are known as heteroleptic. \n\nNomenclature is important in Coordination Chemistry because of the need to have an unambiguous method of describing formulas and writing systematic names, particularly when dealing with isomers. The formulas and names adopted for coordination entities are based on the recommendations of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). \n\n5.3.1 Formulas of Mononuclear Coordination Entities \n\nNote: The 2004 IUPAC draft recommends that ligands will be sorted alphabetically, irrespective of charge. \n\n5.3.2 Naming of Mononuclear Coordination Compounds \n\nNote: The 2004   \nIUPAC draft   \nrecommends that   \nanionic ligands will end with-ido so that chloro would become chlorido, etc. \n\nThe formula of a compound is a shorthand tool used to provide basic information about the constitution of the compound in a concise and convenient manner. Mononuclear coordination entities contain a single central metal atom. The following rules are applied while writing the formulas: \n\n(i) The central atom is listed first.   \n(ii) The ligands are then listed in alphabetical order. The placement of a ligand in the list does not depend on its charge.   \n(ii) Polydentate ligands are also listed alphabetically. In case of abbreviated ligand, the first letter of the abbreviation is used to determine the position of the ligand in the alphabetical order.   \n(iv) The formula for the entire coordination entity, whether charged or not, is enclosed in square brackets. when ligands are polyatomic, their formulas are enclosed in parentheses. Ligand abbreviations are also enclosed in parentheses.   \n(v) There should be no space between the ligands and the metal within a coordination sphere.   \n(vi) when the formula of a charged coordination entity is to be written without that of the counter ion, the charge is indicated outside the square brackets as a right superscript with the number before the sign. For example, $\\mathrm { [ C o ( \\bar { C } N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ , $\\mathrm { [ C r ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 + } }$ ,etc.   \nvii) The charge of the cation(s) is balanced by the charge of the anion(s). \n\nThe names of coordination compounds are derived by following the principles of additive nomenclature. Thus, the groups that surround the central atom must be identified in the name. They are listed as prefixes to the name of the central atom along with any appropriate multipliers. The following rules are used when naming coordination compounds: \n\n(i) The cation is named first in both positively and negatively charged coordination entities.   \n(üi) The ligands are named in an alphabetical order before the name of the central atom/ion. (This procedure is reversed from writing formula).   \n(i) Names of the anionic ligands end in $^ { - 0 }$ , those of neutral and cationic ligands are the same except aqua for $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ ,ammine for $\\mathrm { N H _ { 3 } }$ , carbonyl for CO and nitrosyl for NO. While writing the formula of coordination entity, these are enclosed in brackets ( ).   \n(iv) Prefixes mono, di, tri, etc., are used to indicate the number of the individual ligands in the coordination entity. when the names of the ligands include a numerical prefix, then the terms, bis, tris, tetrakis are used, the ligand to which they refer being placed in parentheses. For example, $\\mathrm { [ N i C l _ { 2 } ( P P h _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } ] }$ is named as dichloridobis(triphenylphosphine)nickel(II).   \n(v) Oxidation state of the metal in cation, anion or neutral coordination entity is indicated by Roman numeral in parenthesis.   \n(vi) If the complex ion is a cation, the metal is named same as the element. For example, Co in a complex cation is called cobalt and $\\mathrm { P t }$ is called platinum. If the complex ion is an anion, the name of the metal ends with the suffix – ate. For example, Co in a complex anion, $\\left[ \\mathrm { C o } \\left( \\mathrm { S C N } \\right) _ { 4 } \\right] ^ { 2 - }$ is called cobaltate. For some metals, the Latin names are used in the complex anions, e.g., ferrate for Fe. \n\n(vii) The neutral complex molecule is named similar to that of the complex cation. \n\nThe following examples illustrate the nomenclature for coordination compounds. \n\nNotice how the name of the metal differs in cation and anion even though they contain the same metal ions. \n\n1. $\\mathrm { [ C r ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 3 } ] C l _ { 3 } }$ is named as: triamminetriaquachromium(Il) chloride \n\nExplanation: The complex ion is inside the square bracket, which is a cation. The amine ligands are named before the aqua ligands according to alphabetical order. Since there are three chloride ions in the compound, the charge on the complex ion must be $+ 3$ (since the compound is electrically neutral). From the charge on the complex ion and the charge on the ligands, we can calculate the oxidation number of the metal. In this example, all the ligands are neutral molecules. Therefore, the oxidation number of chromium must be the same as the charge of the complex ion, $+ 3$ . \n\n2. $\\mathrm { [ C o ( H _ { 2 } N C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 2 } N H _ { 2 } ) _ { 3 } ] _ { 2 } ( S O _ { 4 } ) _ { 3 } }$ is named as: tris(ethane-1,2-diamine)cobalt(Il) sulphate \n\nExplanation: The sulphate is the counter anion in this molecule. Since it takes 3 sulphates to bond with two complex cations, the charge on each complex cation must be $+ 3$ . Further, ethane- $^ { 1 , 2 - }$ diamine is a neutral molecule, so the oxidation number of cobalt in the complex ion must be $+ 3$ . Remember that you never have to indicate the number of cations and anions in the name of an ionic compound. \n\n3. $\\mathrm { \\small { [ A g ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } ] [ A g ( C N ) _ { 2 } ] } }$ is named as: diamminesilver(l)dicyanidoargentate(I) \n\nExample 5.2 write the formulas for the following coordination compounds: \n\n(a) tetraammineaquachloridocobalt(Il) chloride (b) potassium tetrahydroxidozincate(Il) (c) potassium trioxalatoaluminate(IIl) (d) dichloridobis(ethane-1,2-diamine)cobalt(I) (e) tetracarbonylnickel(O) \n\nSolution (a) $\\mathrm { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 4 } ( H _ { 2 } O ) C l l C l _ { 2 } }$ (b) $\\mathrm { K _ { 2 } [ Z n ( O H ) _ { 4 } ] }$ (c) $\\mathrm { K _ { 3 } [ A l ( C _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } ) _ { 3 } ] }$ (d) $\\mathrm { [ C o C l _ { 2 } ( e n ) _ { 2 } l ^ { + } }$ (cid:) (e) $\\mathrm { [ N i ( C O ) _ { 4 } ] }$ (cid:) \n\nExample 5.3 Write the IUPAC names of the following coordination compounds: \n\n(a) $\\mathrm { { [ P t ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } C l ( N O _ { 2 } ) l } }$ (cid:) (b) $\\mathrm { K _ { 3 } [ C r ( C _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } ) _ { 3 } ] }$ (cid:) (c) $\\mathrm { [ C o C l _ { 2 } ( e n ) _ { 2 } ] C l }$ (d) $\\mathrm { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } ( C O _ { 3 } ) ] C l }$ (e) $\\mathrm { H g } [ \\mathrm { C o } ( \\mathrm { S C N } ) _ { 4 } ]$ \n\nSolution (a) diamminechloridonitrito-N-platinum(I) (b) potassium trioxalatochromate(I) (c) dichloridobis(ethane-1,2-diamine)cobalt(Il) chloride (d) pentaamminecarbonatocobalt(IIl) chloride (e) mercury (I) tetrathiocyanato-S-cobaltate(Il) \n\nIntext Questions \n\n5.1 Write the formulas for the following coordination compounds: \n\n(i) tetraamminediaquacobalt(Ill) chloride   \n(i) potassium tetracyanidonickelate(I)   \n(ii) tris(ethane-1,2–diamine) chromium(Ill) chloride   \n(iv) amminebromidochloridonitrito-N-platinate(II)   \n(V) dichloridobis(ethane-1,2-diamine)platinum(IV) nitrate   \n(vi) iron(IIl) hexacyanidoferrate(II) \n\n5.2 Write the IUPAC names of the following coordination compounds: \n\n(i) $\\mathrm { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } ] C l _ { 3 } }$ (i) $\\mathrm { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } C l l C l _ { 2 } }$ (ii) $\\mathrm { K _ { 3 } I F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } l }$ (cid:) (iv) $\\mathrm { K _ { 3 } [ F e ( C _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } ) _ { 3 } ] }$ (v) $\\mathrm { K _ { 2 } [ P d C l _ { 4 } ] }$ (vi) $\\mathrm { { [ P t ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } C l ( N H _ { 2 } C H _ { 3 } ) l C l } }$ \n\n5.4 Isomerism in Coordination Compounds \n\nIsomers are two or more compounds that have the same chemical formula but a different arrangement of atoms. Because of the different arrangement of atoms, they differ in one or more physical or chemical properties. Two principal types of isomerism are known among coordination compounds. Each of which can be further subdivided. \n\n(a) Stereoisomerism \n\n(i) Geometrical isomerism (i) Optical isomerism \n\n(b) Structural isomerism \n\n(i) Linkage isomerism (ii) Coordination isomerism (ii) Ionisation isomerism (iv) Solvate isomerism \n\nStereoisomers have the same chemical formula and chemical bonds but they have different spatial arrangement. Structural isomers have different bonds. A detailed account of these isomers are given below. - \n\n5.4.1 Geometric Isomerism \n\nThis type of isomerism arises in heteroleptic complexes due to different possible geometric arrangements of the ligands. Important examples of this behaviour are found with coordination numbers 4 and 6. In a square planar complex of formula $\\mathrm { [ M X _ { 2 } L _ { 2 } ] }$ (X and L are unidentate), the two ligands X may be arranged adjacent to each other in a cis isomer, or opposite to each other in a trans isomer as depicted in Fig. 5.2. \n\nOther square planar complex of the type MABXL (where A, B, X, L are unidentates) shows three isomers-two cis and one trans. You may attempt to draw these structures. Such isomerism is not possible for a tetrahedral geometry but similar behaviour is possible in octahedral complexes of formula $\\mathrm { [ M X _ { 2 } L _ { 4 } ] }$ in which the two ligands X may be oriented cis or trans to each other (Fig. 5.3). \n\nThis type of isomerism also arises when didentate ligands $\\mathrm { L } - \\mathrm { L }$ le.g., $\\mathrm { { N H _ { 2 } } \\ C H _ { 2 } \\ C H _ { 2 } \\ N H _ { 2 } }$ (en)] are present in complexes of formula $\\mathrm { [ M X _ { 2 } ( L - L ) _ { 2 } ] }$ (Fig. 5.4). \n\nAnother type of geometrical isomerism occurs in octahedral coordination entities of the type $[ \\bf { M a } _ { 3 } \\mathbf { b } _ { 3 } ]$ like $\\mathrm { \\small { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } ( N O _ { 2 } ) _ { 3 } ] } }$ . If three donor atoms of the same ligands occupy adjacent positions at the corners of an octahedral face, we have the facial (fac) isomer. When the positions are around the meridian of the octahedron, we get the meridional (mer) isomer (Fig. 5.5). \n\nwhy is geometrical isomerism not possible in tetrahedral complexes having two different types of unidentate ligands coordinated with the central metal ion ? - - \n\nExample 5.4 \n\nTetrahedral complexes do not show geometrical isomerism because the relative positions of the unidentate ligands attached to the central metal atom are the same with respect to each other. \n\nSolution \n\n5.4.2 Optical Isomerism \n\nOptical isomers are mirror images that cannot be superimposed on one another. These are called as enantiomers. The molecules or ions that cannot be superimposed are called chiral. The two forms are called dextro (d) and laevo (l) depending upon the direction they rotate the plane of polarised light in a polarimeter ( $d$ rotates to the right, I to the left). Optical isomerism is common in octahedral complexes involving didentate ligands (Fig. 5.6). \n\nIn a coordination entity of the type $\\mathrm { \\Delta [ P t C l _ { 2 } ( e n ) _ { 2 } ] ^ { 2 + } }$ , only the cis-isomer shows optical activity (Fig. 5.7). \n\nExample 5.5 \n\nSolution \n\nDraw structures of geometrical isomers of $\\mathrm { | F e ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } ( C N ) _ { 4 } | ^ { - } }$ \n\nNH₃ NH₃   \nNC | NH3 NC (ci:) CN   \nFe Fe   \nNC CN NC CN   \nCN NH₃   \ncis trans \n\nExample 5.6 \n\nOut of the following two coordination entities which is chiral (optically active)? \n\n(a) cis $\\mathrm { { [ C r C l _ { 2 } ( o x ) _ { 2 } ] } ^ { 3 - } }$ (cid:) $\\mathrm { ( b ) } \\ t r a n s { \\mathrm { - } } [ \\mathrm { C r C l _ { 2 } ( o x ) _ { 2 } } ] ^ { \\mathrm { 3 - } }$ \n\nSolution \n\nThe two entities are represented as \n\nOut of the two, (a) cis - $\\mathrm { [ C r C l _ { 2 } ( o x ) _ { 2 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ is chiral (optically active). \n\n5.4.3 Linkage Isomerism \n\nLinkage isomerism arises in a coordination compound containing ambidentate ligand. A simple example is provided by complexes containing the thiocyanate ligand, NCS, which may bind through the nitrogen to give M-NCS or through sulphur to give M-SCN. Jorgensen discovered such behaviour in the complex $\\mathrm { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } ( N O _ { 2 } ) l C l _ { 2 } }$ which is obtained as the red form, in which the nitrite ligand is bound through oxygen (-ONO), and as the yellow form, in which the nitrite ligand is bound through nitrogen $\\left( - \\mathbf { N O } _ { 2 } \\right)$ . \n\n5.4.4 Coordination Isomerism \n\nThis type of isomerism arises from the interchange of ligands between cationic and anionic entities of different metal ions present in a complex. An example is provided by $\\mathrm { \\small { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } ] [ C r ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] } }$ , in which the $\\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }$ ligands are bound to ${ \\mathsf { \\bar { C } } } { \\mathsf { o } } ^ { 3 + }$ and the $\\mathbf { C N }$ ligands to ${ \\mathrm { C r } } ^ { 3 + }$ . In its coordination isomer $\\mathrm { [ C r ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } ] [ C o ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] }$ ,the $\\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }$ ligands are bound to $\\mathrm { C r } ^ { 3 + }$ and the $\\mathbf { C N }$ ligands to $\\mathrm { C o } ^ { 3 + }$ . \n\n5.4.5 Ionisation Isomerism \n\nThis form of isomerism arises when the counter ion in a complex salt is itself a potential ligand and can displace a ligand which can then become the counter ion. An example is provided by the ionisation isomers $\\mathrm { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } ( S O _ { 4 } ) ] B r }$ and $\\mathrm { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } B r ] S O _ { 4 } }$ . \n\n5.4.6 Solvate Isomerism \n\nThis form of isomerism is known as 'hydrate isomerism' in case where water is involved as a solvent. This is similar to ionisation isomerism. Solvate isomers differ by whether or not a solvent molecule is directly bonded to the metal ion or merely present as free solvent moleculesin the crystal lattice. An example is provided by the aqua complex $\\mathrm { [ C r ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 6 } ] C l _ { 3 } }$ (violet) and its solvate isomer $\\mathrm { [ C r ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 5 } C l l C l _ { 2 } . H _ { 2 } O }$ (grey-green). \n\nIntext Questions \n\n5.3 Indicate the types of isomerism exhibited by the following complexes and draw the structures for these isomers: \n\n(i) $\\mathrm { K I C r ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 2 } ( C _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } }$ (ii) [Co(en)s]C13 (i) $\\mathrm { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } ( N O _ { 2 } ) l ( N O _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } }$ (iv) [Pt(NH3)(H2O)C12] \n\n5.4 Give evidence that $\\mathrm { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } C l l S O _ { 4 } }$ and $\\mathrm { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } ( S O _ { 4 } ) l C l }$ are ionisation isomers. \n\n5.5 Bonding in Coordination Compounds \n\nWerner was the first to describe the bonding features in coordination compounds. But his theory could not answer basic questions like: \n\n(i) why only certain elements possess the remarkable property of forming coordination compounds?   \n(ii) why the bonds in coordination compounds have directional properties?   \n(ii) why coordination compounds have characteristic magnetic and optical properties? \n\nMany approaches have been put forth to explain the nature of bonding in coordination compounds viz. Valence Bond Theory (VBT), Crystal Field Theory (CFT), Ligand Field Theory (LFT) and Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT). we shall focus our attention on elementary treatment of the application of VBT and CFT to coordination compounds. \n\n5.5.1 Valence Bond Theory \n\nAccording to this theory, the metal atom or ion under the influence of ligands can use its $[ \\mathrm { n - 1 } ] d$ ,ns, $_ { \\mathrm { n } p }$ or ns, np, nd orbitals for hybridisation to yield a set of equivalent orbitals of definite geometry such as octahedral, tetrahedral, square planar and so on (Table 5.2). These hybridised orbitals are allowed to overlap with ligand orbitals that can donate electron pairs for bonding. This is illustrated by the following examples. \n\nOrbitals of Co3+ion $d ^ { 2 } s p ^ { 3 }$ hybridised orbitals of $\\mathrm { C o ^ { 3 + } }$ (cid:) \n\nthe knowledge of its magnetic behaviour on the basis of the valence bond theory. \n\nIt is usually possible to predict the geometry of a complex from \n\n$\\mathrm { \\small { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } ] } ^ { 3 + } }$ (cid:) (inner orbital or low spin complex) \n\nSix pairs of electrons from six $\\mathrm { N H _ { 3 } }$ molecules \n\nIn the diamagnetic octahedral complex, $\\mathrm { \\left[ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } \\right] ^ { 3 + } }$ , the cobalt ion is in $+ 3$ oxidation state and has the electronic configuration $3 d ^ { 6 }$ .The hybridisation scheme is as shown in diagram. \n\nOrbitals of Co3+ion $s p ^ { 3 } d ^ { 2 }$ hybridised orbitals of $\\mathrm { C o } ^ { 3 + }$ (cid:) \n\n$\\mathrm { [ C o F _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ (outer orbital or high spin complex) \n\nSix pairs of electrons, one from each $\\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }$ molecule, occupy the six hybrid orbitals. Thus, the complex has octahedral geometry and is diamagnetic because of the absence of unpaired electron. In the formation of this complex, since the inner $d$ orbital $( 3 d )$ is used in hybridisation, the complex, $\\mathrm { \\left[ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } \\right] ^ { 3 + } }$ is called an inner orbital or low spin or spin paired complex. The paramagnetic octahedral complex, $\\left[ \\mathrm { C o F _ { 6 } } \\right] ^ { 3 - }$ uses outer orbital $( 4 d )$ in hybridisation $( s p ^ { 3 } d ^ { 2 } )$ . It is thus called outer orbital or high spin or spin free complex. Thus: \n\nOrbitals of Ni²tion $s p ^ { 3 }$ hybridised orbitals of $\\mathrm { N i ^ { 2 + } }$ $\\mathrm { [ N i C l _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 - } }$ (cid:) (high spin complex) \n\nIn tetrahedral complexes one $s$ and three $p$ orbitals are hybridised to form four equivalent orbitals oriented tetrahedrally. This is illustrated below for $\\mathrm { [ N i C l _ { 4 } ] } ^ { 2 - }$ . Here nickel is in $+ 2$ oxidation state and the ion has the electronic configuration $3 d ^ { 8 }$ . The hybridisation scheme is as shown in diagram. \n\nEach $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ ion donates a pair of electrons. The compound is paramagnetic since it contains two unpaired electrons. Similarly, $\\mathrm { [ N i ( C O ) _ { 4 } ] }$ has tetrahedral geometry but is diamagnetic since nickel is in zero oxidation state and contains no unpaired electron. \n\nIn the square planar complexes, the hybridisation involved is $d s p ^ { 2 }$ . An example is $\\mathrm { [ N i ( C N ) _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 - } }$ . Here nickel is in $+ 2$ oxidation state and has the electronic configuration $3 d ^ { 8 }$ . The hybridisation scheme is as shown in diagram: \n\nOrbitals of $\\mathrm { N i ^ { 2 + } }$ ion ↑↓↑↓ ↑ ↑ 3d 4s 4p   \ndsphf $\\mathrm { N i ^ { 2 + } }$ (d ↑↓ ↑↓↑↓ 3d dsp2 hydrid 4p   \n$\\mathrm { [ N i ( C N ) _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 - } }$ complex) ↑↓↑↓↑↓ 3d Four pairs of electrons 4p from 4 CN groups \n\nEach of the hybridised orbitals receives a pair of electrons from a cyanide ion. The compound is diamagnetic as evident from the absence of unpaired electron. \n\nIt is important to note that the hybrid orbitals do not actually exist. In fact, hybridisation is a mathematical manipulation of wave equation for the atomic orbitals involved. \n\n5.5.2 Magnetic Properties of Coordination Compounds \n\nThe magnetic moment of coordination compounds can be measured by the magnetic susceptibility experiments. The results can be used to obtain information about the number of unpaired electrons and hence structures adopted by metal complexes. \n\nA critical study of the magnetic data of coordination compounds of metals of the first transition series reveals some complications. For metal ions with upto three electrons in the $d$ orbitals, like $\\mathrm { T i } ^ { 3 + } ( d ^ { 1 } )$ ; ${ \\mathrm { V } } ^ { 3 + }$ $( d ^ { 2 } )$ ; $\\mathrm { C r } ^ { 3 + } \\ ( d ^ { 3 } )$ ; two vacant $d$ orbitals are available for octahedral hybridisation with $4 s$ and $4 p$ orbitals. The magnetic behaviour of these free ions and their coordination entities is similar. When more than three $3 d$ electrons are present, the required pair of $3 d$ orbitals for octahedral hybridisation is not directly available (as a consequence of Hund's rule). Thus, for $d ^ { 4 } ~ ( \\mathrm { C r ^ { 2 + } , ~ M n ^ { 3 + } } )$ , $d ^ { 5 }$ $( \\mathrm { M n ^ { 2 + } , \\ F e ^ { 3 + } } )$ , $d ^ { 6 }$ (cid:) $( \\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ , $\\mathrm { C o } ^ { 3 + } )$ cases, a vacant pair of $d$ orbitals results only by pairing of $3 d$ electrons which leaves two, one and zero unpaired electrons, respectively. \n\nThe magnetic data agree with maximum spin pairing in many cases, especially with coordination compounds containing $d ^ { \\widetilde { 6 } }$ ions. However, with species containing $d ^ { 4 }$ and $\\boldsymbol { d } ^ { 5 }$ ions there are complications. $\\mathrm { [ M n ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ has magnetic moment of two unpaired electrons while $\\mathrm { [ M n C l _ { 6 } ] } ^ { 3 - }$ has a paramagnetic moment of four unpaired electrons. $\\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ has magnetic moment of a single unpaired electron while $\\mathrm { [ F e F _ { 6 } ] } ^ { 3 - }$ has a paramagnetic moment of five unpaired electrons. $\\mathrm { [ C o F _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ is paramagnetic with four unpaired electrons while $\\mathrm { [ C o ( C _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } ) _ { 3 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ is diamagnetic. This apparent anomaly is explained by valence bond theory in terms of formation of inner orbital and outer orbital coordination entities. $\\mathrm { { [ M n ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] } ^ { 3 - } }$ , $\\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ and $\\mathrm { { [ C o ( C _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } ) _ { 3 } ] } ^ { 3 - } }$ are inner orbital complexes involving $d ^ { 2 } s p ^ { 3 }$ hybridisation, the former two complexes are paramagnetic and the latter diamagnetic. On the other hand, $\\mathrm { [ M n C l _ { 6 } ] } ^ { 3 - }$ , $\\mathrm { [ F e F _ { 6 } ] } ^ { 3 - }$ and $\\mathrm { [ C o F _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ are outer orbital complexes involving $s p ^ { 3 } d ^ { 2 }$ hybridisation and are paramagnetic corresponding to four, five and four unpaired electrons. \n\nExample 5.7 \n\nThe spin only magnetic moment of $\\mathrm { [ M n B r _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 - } }$ is 5.9 BM. Predict the geometry of the complex ion ? \n\nSince the coordination number of $\\mathrm { M n } ^ { 2 ^ { + } }$ ion in the complex ion is 4, it will be either tetrahedral $: s p ^ { 3 }$ hybridisation) or square planar $\\left( d s p ^ { 2 } \\right.$ hybridisation). But the fact that the magnetic moment of the complex ion is 5.9 BM, it should be tetrahedral in shape rather than square planar because of the presence of five unpaired electrons in the $d$ orbitals. \n\n5.5.3 Limitations of Valence Bond Theory \n\nWhile the VB theory, to a larger extent, explains the formation, structures and magnetic behaviour of coordination compounds, it suffers from the following shortcomings: \n\n(i) It involves a number of assumptions.   \n(ii) It does not give quantitative interpretation of magnetic data.   \n(ii) It does not explain the colour exhibited by coordination compounds.   \n(iv) It does not give a quantitative interpretation of the thermodynamic or kinetic stabilities of coordination compounds.   \n(v) It does not make exact predictions regarding the tetrahedral and square planar structures of 4-coordinate complexes.   \n(vi) It does not distinguish between weak and strong ligands. \n\n5.5.4 Crystal Field Theory \n\nThe crystal field theory (CFT) is an electrostatic model which considers the metal-ligand bond to be ionic arising purely from electrostatic interactions between the metal ion and the ligand. Ligands are treated as point charges in case of anions or point dipoles in case of neutral molecules. The five $d$ orbitals in an isolated gaseous metal atom/ion have same energy, i.e., they are degenerate. This degeneracy is maintained if a spherically symmetrical field of negative charges surrounds the metal atom/ion. However, when this negative field is due to ligands (either anions or the negative ends of dipolar molecules like $\\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }$ and $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } ]$ in a complex, it becomes asymmetrical and the degeneracy of the $d$ orbitals is lifted. It results in splitting of the $d$ orbitals. The pattern of splitting depends upon the nature of the crystal field. Let us explain this splitting in different crystal fields. \n\n(a) Crystal field splitting in octahedral coordination entities \n\nIn an octahedral coordination entity with six ligands surrounding the metal atom/ion, there will be repulsion between the electrons in metal $d$ orbitals and the electrons (or negative charges) of the ligands. Such a repulsion is more when the metal $d$ orbital is directed towards the ligand than when it is away from the ligand. Thus, the $d _ { \\mathrm { x ^ { 2 } - y ^ { 2 } } }$ (cid:) and $d _ { { } _ { z } { } ^ { 2 } }$ orbitals which point towards the axes along the direction of the ligand will experience more repulsion and will be raised in energy; and the $d _ { \\mathrm { x y } }$ , $d _ { \\mathrm { y z } }$ and $d _ { \\mathrm { x z } }$ orbitals which are directed between the axes will be lowered in energy relative to the average energy in the spherical crystal field. Thus, the degeneracy of the $d$ orbitals has been removed due to ligand electron-metal electron repulsions in the octahedral complex to yield three orbitals of lower energy, $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ set and two orbitals of higher energy, $e _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ set. This splitting of the \n\ndegenerate levels due to the presence of ligands in a definite geometry is termed as crystal field splitting and the energy separation is denoted by $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { o } }$ (the subscript o is for octahedral) (Fig.5.8). Thus, the energy of the two $e _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ orbitals will increase by (3/5) $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { o } }$ and that of the three $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ will decrease by $( 2 / 5 ) \\Delta _ { \\mathrm { o } }$ \n\nThe crystal field splitting, $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { o } }$ , depends upon the field produced by the ligand and charge on the metal ion. Some ligands are able to produce strong fields in which case, the splitting will be large whereas others produce weak fields and consequently result in small splitting of $d$ orbitals. \n\nIn general, ligands can be arranged in a series in the order of increasing field strength as given below: \n\nSuch a series is termed as spectrochemical series. It is an experimentally determined series based on the absorption of light by complexes with different ligands. Let us assign electrons in the $d$ orbitals of metal ion in octahedral coordination entities. Obviously, the single $d$ electron occupies one of the lower energy $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ orbitals. In $d ^ { 2 }$ and $\\bar { \\boldsymbol { d } } ^ { 3 }$ coordination entities, the $d$ electrons occupy the $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ orbitals singly in accordance with the Hund's rule. For $d ^ { 4 }$ ions, two possible patterns of electron distribution arise: (i) the fourth electron could either enter the $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ level and pair with an existing electron, or (i) it could avoid paying the price of the pairing energy by occupying the $e _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ level. Which of these possibilities occurs, depends on the relative magnitude of the crystal field splitting, $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { o } }$ and the pairing energy, P (P represents the energy required for electron pairing in a single orbital). The two options are: \n\n(i) If $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { o } } < \\mathrm { P } ,$ , the fourth electron enters one of the $e _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ orbitals giving the   \nconfguration $t _ { \\mathrm { 2 g } } ^ { 3 } e _ { \\mathrm { g } } ^ { 1 } .$ Ligands for which are known as weak $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { o } } < \\mathrm { P }$ field ligands and form high spin complexes.   \n(i) If $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { o } } > \\mathrm { P } ,$ , it becomes more energetically favourable for the fourth electron to occupy a $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ orbital with configuration ${ t _ { \\mathrm { 2 g } } } ^ { 4 } { e _ { \\mathrm { g } } } ^ { 0 }$ . Ligands which produce this effect are known as strong field ligands and form low spin complexes. \n\nCalculations show that $d ^ { 4 }$ to $d ^ { 7 }$ coordination entities are more stable for strong field as compared to weak field cases. \n\nIn tetrahedral coordination entity formation, the $d$ orbital splitting (Fig. 5.9) is inverted and is smaller as compared to the octahedral field splitting. For the same metal, the same ligands and metal-ligand distances, it can be shown that $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { t } } = ( 4 / 9 )$ (cid:) $\\Delta _ { 0 }$ . Consequently, the orbital splitting energies are not sufficiently large for forcing pairing and, therefore, low spin configurations are rarely observed. The $\\cdot _ { \\mathrm { g } } ^ { \\mathrm { g } ^ { \\ast } }$ subscript is used for the octahedral and square planar complexes which have centre of symmetry. Since tetrahedral complexes lack symmetry, 'g' subscript is not used with energy levels. \n\n5.5.5 Colour in Coordination Compounds \n\nIn the previous Unit, we learnt that one of the most distinctive properties of transition metal complexes is their wide range of colours. This means that some of the visible spectrum is being removed from white light as it passes through the sample, so the light that emerges is no longer white. The colour of the complex is complementary to that which is absorbed. The complementary colour is the colour generated from the wavelength left over; if green light is absorbed by the complex, it appears red, Table 5.3 gives the relationship of the different wavelength absorbed and the colour observed. \n\nThe colour in the coordination compounds can be readily explained in terms of the crystal field theory. Consider, for example, the complex $\\mathrm { [ T i ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 + } }$ , which is violet in colour. This is an octahedral complex where the single electron $\\mathrm { ( T i ^ { 3 + } }$ is a $3 d ^ { 1 }$ system) in the metal $d$ orbital is in the $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ level in the ground state of the complex. The next higher state available for the electron is the empty $e _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ level. If light corresponding to the energy of blue-green region is absorbed by the complex, it would excite the electron from $t _ { \\mathrm { { 2 g } } }$ level to the $e _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ $( { t _ { 2 } } _ { \\mathrm { g } } ^ { 1 } { { \\stackrel { \\bullet } { e _ { \\mathrm { g } } } } } ^ { 0 }  { t _ { 2 } } _ { \\mathrm { g } } ^ { 0 } { { e _ { \\mathrm { g } } } } ^ { 1 } )$ Consequently, the complex appears violet in colour (Fig. 5.10). The crystal field theory attributes the colour of the coordination compounds to $d \\ – d$ transition of the electron. \n\nIt is important to note that in the absence of ligand, crystal field splitting does not occur and hence the substance is colourless. For example, removal of water from $\\mathrm { [ T i ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 6 } ] C l _ { 3 } } +$ on heating renders it colourless. Similarly, anhydrous $\\mathrm { C u S O _ { 4 } }$ is white, but $\\mathrm { C u S O _ { 4 } . 5 H _ { 2 } O }$ is blue in colour. The influence of the ligand on the colour \n\nof a complex may be illustrated by considering the $\\mathrm { [ N i ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 2 + } }$ complex, which forms when nickel(Il) chloride is dissolved in water. If the didentate ligand, ethane-1,2-diamine(en) is progressively added in the molar ratios en:Ni, 1:1, 2: 1, 3: 1, the following series of reactions and their associated colour changes occur: \n\nThis sequence is shown in Fig. 5.11. \n\nColour of Some Gem Stones \n\nThe colours produced by electronic transitions within the $d$ orbitals of a transition metal ion occur frequently in everyday life. Ruby [Fig.5.12(a)】 is aluminium oxide $\\mathrm { ( A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } ) }$ containing about $0 . 5 – 1 \\%$ (cid:) $\\mathrm { C r } ^ { 3 + }$ ions $( d ^ { 3 } )$ , which are randomly distributed in positions normally occupied by ${ \\mathrm { A l } } ^ { 3 + }$ . We may view these chromium(Il) species as octahedral chromium(Il) complexes incorporated into the alumina lattice; $d { - } d$ transitions at these centres give rise to the colour. \n\nIn emerald [Fig.5.12(b)], $\\mathrm { C r } ^ { 3 + }$ ions occupy octahedral sites in the mineral beryl $\\mathrm { ( B e _ { 3 } A l _ { 2 } S i _ { 6 } O _ { 1 8 } ) }$ . The absorption bands seen in the ruby shift to longer wavelength, namely yellow-red and blue, causing emerald to transmit light in the green region. \n\n5.5.6 Limitations of Crystal Field Theory \n\nThe crystal field model is successful in explaining the formation, structures, colour and magnetic properties of coordination compounds to a large extent. However, from the assumptions that the ligands are point charges, it follows that anionic ligands should exert the greatest splitting effect. The anionic ligands actually are found at the low end of the spectrochemical series. Further, it does not take into account the covalent character of bonding between the ligand and the central atom. These are some of the weaknesses of CFT, which are explained by ligand field theory (LFT) and molecular orbital theory which are beyond the scope of the present study. \n\nIntext Questions \n\n5.5 Explain on the basis of valence bond theory that $\\mathrm { [ N i ( C N ) _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 - } }$ ion with square planar structure is diamagnetic and the $\\mathrm { [ N i C l _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 - } }$ ion with tetrahedral geometry is paramagnetic.   \n5.6 $\\mathrm { [ N i C l _ { 4 } ] } ^ { 2 - }$ is paramagnetic while $\\mathrm { [ N i ( C O ) _ { 4 } ] }$ is diamagnetic though both are tetrahedral. why?   \n5.7 $\\mathrm { { [ F e ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 6 } l ^ { 3 + } } }$ is strongly paramagnetic whereas $\\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ is weakly paramagnetic. Explain.   \n5.8 Explain $\\mathrm { \\Delta [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 + } }$ is an inner orbital complex whereas $\\mathrm { [ N i ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 2 + } }$ is an outer orbital complex.   \n5.9 Predict the number of unpaired electrons in the square planar $\\mathrm { [ P t ( C N ) _ { 4 } ] } ^ { 2 - }$ ion.   \n5.10 The hexaquo manganese(Il) ion contains five unpaired electrons, while the hexacyanoion contains only one unpaired electron. Explain using Crystal Field Theory. \n\n5.6 Bonding in Metal Carbonyls \n\nThe homoleptic carbonyls (compounds containing carbonyl ligands only) are formed by most of the transition metals. These carbonyls have simple, well defined structures. Tetracarbonylnickel(O) is tetrahedral, pentacarbonyliron(O) is trigonalbipyramidal while hexacarbonyl chromium(O) is octahedral. \n\nDecacarbonyldimanganese(O) is made up of two square pyramidal $\\mathbf { M n } ( \\mathbf { C O } ) _ { 5 }$ units joined by a Mn – Mn bond. Octacarbonyldicobalt(O) has a Co – Co bond bridged by two CO groups (Fig.5.13). \n\nThe metal-carbon bond in metal carbonyls possess both $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ character. The $\\mathbf { M } { - } \\mathbf { C } \\mathbf { \\Lambda } \\sigma$ bond is formed by the donation of lone pair of electrons on the carbonyl carbon into a vacant orbital of the metal. The M-C $\\pi$ bond is formed by the donation of a pair of electrons from a filled $d$ orbital of metal into the vacant antibonding $\\pi ^ { * }$ orbital of carbon monoxide. The metal to ligand bonding creates a synergic effect which strengthens the bond between CO and the metal (Fig.5.14). \n\n5.7 Importance and Applications of Coordination Compounds \n\nThe coordination compounds are of great importance. These compounds are widely present in the mineral, plant and animal worlds and are known to play many important functions in the area of analytical chemistry, metallurgy, biological systems, industry and medicine. These are described below: \n\nCoordination compounds find use in many qualitative and quantitative chemical analysis. The familiar colour reactions given by metal ions with a number of ligands (especially chelating ligands), as a result of formation of coordination entities, form the basis for their detection and estimation by classical and instrumental methods of analysis. Examples of such reagents include EDTA, DMG - (dimethylglyoxime), $\\alpha$ -nitroso- $\\cdot \\mathrm { \\{ \\} }$ —naphthol, cupron, etc. Hardness of water is estimated by simple titration with $\\mathrm { N a _ { 2 } E D T A }$ The $\\mathrm { { C a } ^ { 2 + } }$ and $\\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ ions form stable complexes with EDTA. The selective estimation of these ions can be done due to difference in the stability constants of calcium and magnesium complexes. Some important extraction processes of metals, like those of silver and gold, make use of complex formation. Gold, for example, combines with cyanide in the presence of oxygen and water to form the coordination entity $[ \\mathrm { A u ( C N ) _ { 2 } } ] ^ { - }$ in aqueous solution. Gold can be separated in metallic form from this solution by the addition of zinc. Similarly, purification of metals can be achieved through formation and subsequent decomposition of their coordination compounds. \n\nFor example, impure nickel is converted to $\\mathrm { [ N i ( C O ) _ { 4 } ] }$ , which is decomposed to yield pure nickel. \n\nCoordination compounds are of great importance in biological systems. The pigment responsible for photosynthesis, chlorophyll, is a coordination compound of magnesium. Haemoglobin, the red pigment of blood which acts as oxygen carrier is a coordination compound of iron. Vitamin $\\mathrm { { B } } _ { 1 2 }$ , cyanocobalamine, the antipernicious anaemia factor, is a coordination compound of cobalt. Among the other compounds of biological importance with coordinated metal ions are the enzymes like, carboxypeptidase A and carbonic anhydrase (catalysts of biological systems).   \n● Coordination compounds are used as catalysts for many industrial processes. Examples include rhodium complex, $[ ( \\mathrm { P h } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { P } ) _ { 3 } \\mathrm { R h } \\mathrm { C l } ]$ ,a wilkinson catalyst, is used for the hydrogenation of alkenes.   \n● Articles can be electroplated with silver and gold much more smoothly and evenly from solutions of the complexes, $\\mathrm { [ A g ( C N ) _ { 2 } ] ^ { - } }$ and $\\mathrm { [ A u ( C N ) _ { 2 } ] ^ { - } }$ than from a solution of simple metal ions.   \n● In black and white photography, the developed film is fixed by washing with hypo solution which dissolves the undecomposed $\\operatorname { A g B r }$ to form a complex ion, $\\mathrm { \\left[ A g ( S _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } \\right] ^ { 3 - } }$ . There is growing interest in the use of chelate therapy in medicinal chemistry. An example is the treatment of problems caused by the presence of metals in toxic proportions in plant/animal systems. Thus, excess of copper and iron are removed by the chelating ligands D-penicillamine and desferrioxime B via the formation of coordination compounds. EDTA is used in the treatment of lead poisoning. Some coordination compounds of platinum effectively inhibit the growth of tumours. Examples are: cis-platin and related compounds. \n\nSummary \n\nThe chemistry of coordination compounds is an important and challenging area of modern inorganic chemistry. During the last fifty years, advances in this area, have provided development of new concepts and models of bonding and molecular structure, novel breakthroughs in chemical industry and vital insights into the functioning of critical components of biological systems. \n\nThe first systematic attempt at explaining the formation, reactions, structure and bonding of a coordination compound was made by A. werner. His theory postulated the use of two types of linkages (primary and secondary) by a metal atom/ion in a coordination compound. In the modern language of chemistry these linkages are recognised as the ionisable (ionic) and non-ionisable (covalent) bonds, respectively. Using the property of isomerism, Werner predicted the geometrical shapes of a large number of coordination entities. \n\nThe Valence Bond Theory (vBT) explains with reasonable success, the formation, magnetic behaviour and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds. It, however, fails to provide a quantitative interpretation of magnetic behaviour and has nothing to say about the optical properties of these compounds. \n\nThe Crystal Field Theory (CFT) to coordination compounds is based on the effect of different crystal fields (provided by the ligands taken as point charges), on the degeneracy of $d$ orbital energies of the central metal atom/ion. The splitting of the $d$ orbitals provides different electronic arrangements in strong and weak crystal fields. The treatment provides for quantitative estimations of orbital separation energies, magnetic moments and spectral and stability parameters. However, the assumption that ligands consititute point charges creates many theoretical difficulties. \n\nThe metal-carbon bond in metal carbonyls possesses both $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ character. The ligand to metal is $\\sigma$ bond and metal to ligand is $\\pi$ bond. This unique synergic bonding provides stability to metal carbonyls. \n\nCoordination compounds are of great importance. These compounds provide critical insights into the functioning and structures of vital components of biological systems.

(ii) Two optical isomers can exist. (i) There are 10 possible isomers. (Hint: There are geometrical, ionisation and linkage isomers possible). (iv) Geometrical (cis-, trans-) isomers can exist. \n\n5.4 The ionisation isomers dissolve in water to yield different ions and thus react differently to various reagents: (cid:) $\\mathrm { \\small { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } B r ] S O _ { 4 } } ~ + ~ B a ^ { 2 + }  \\Delta B a S O _ { 4 } }$ (s) (cid:) $\\mathrm { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } S O _ { 4 } ] B r }$ + Ba²+→ No reaction (cid:) $\\mathrm { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } B r ] S O _ { 4 } }$ + Ag → No reaction (cid:) $\\mathrm { \\small { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 5 } S O _ { 4 } ] B r } ~ + ~ A g ^ { + }  ~ A g B r }$ (s) \n\n5.6 In $\\mathrm { N i ( C O ) _ { 4 } }$ , Ni is in zero oxidation state whereas in $\\mathrm { { N i C l } _ { 4 } ^ { 2 - } }$ , it is in $+ 2$ oxidation state. In the presence of CO ligand, the unpaired $d$ electrons of Ni pair up but $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ being a weak ligand is unable to pair up the unpaired electrons. \n\n5.7 In presence of $\\mathbf { C N } ^ { - }$ , (a strong ligand) the $3 d$ electrons pair up leaving only one unpaired electron. The hybridisation is $d ^ { 2 } s p ^ { 3 }$ forming inner orbital complex. In the presence of $_ \\mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ ,(a weak ligand), $3 d$ electrons do not pair up. The hybridisation is $s p ^ { 3 } d ^ { 2 }$ forming an outer orbital complex containing five unpaired electrons, it is strongly paramagnetic. \n\n5.8 In the presence of $\\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }$ ,the $3 d$ electrons pair up leaving two $d$ orbitals empty to be involved in $d ^ { 2 } s p ^ { 3 }$ hybridisation forming inner orbital complex in case of $\\mathrm { [ C o ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 + } }$ In $\\mathrm { N i ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 } } ^ { 2 + }$ , Ni is in $+ 2$ oxidation state and has $d ^ { 8 }$ configuration, the hybridisation involved is $s p ^ { 3 } d ^ { 2 }$ forming outer orbital complex. \n\n5.9 For square planar shape, the hybridisation is $d s p ^ { 2 }$ . Hence the unpaired electrons in $5 d$ orbital pair up to make one $d$ orbital empty for $d s p ^ { 2 }$ hybridisation. Thus there is no unpaired electron.",

For such calculations, logarithms are very useful. They help us in making difficult calculations easy. In Chemistry, logarithm values are required in solving problems of chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, etc. We shallfirst introduce this concept, and discuss the laws, which will have to be followed in working with logarithms, and then apply this technique to a number of problems to show how it makes difficult calculations simple. \n\nWe know that   \n$2 ^ { 3 } = 8$ , $3 ^ { 2 } = 9$ , $5 ^ { 3 } = 1 2 5$ ,id $7 ^ { 0 } = 1$   \nIn general, for a positive real number a, and a rational number m, let ${ \\mathrm {  ~ a ~ } } ^ { \\mathrm { \\tiny { m } } } = { \\mathrm {  ~ b ~ } }$ , where b is a real number. In other words   \nthe $\\mathrm { m } ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ power of base a is b.   \nAnother way of stating the same fact is   \nlogarithm of b to base a is m.   \nIf for a positive real number a, $\\mathrm { ~ a ~ } \\neq 1$ blis ${ \\bf a } ^ { \\mathrm { m } } = { \\bf b }$ ,   \nwe say that m is the logarithm of b to the base a. \n\nwe write this as loga $\\log _ { \\mathrm { ~ a ~ } } ^ { \\mathrm { ~ b ~ } } = \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ , \"log\" being the abbreviation of the word \"logarithm\". Thus, we have \n\nLaws of Logarithms \n\nIn the follwing discussion, we shall take logarithms to any base a, $\\mathrm { ~ \\normalfont ~ \\left( a ~ \\right) ~ } ^ { } 0$ and a $\\neq 1$ \n\nFirst Law: $\\mathrm { l o g _ { a } \\ ( m n ) \\ = \\ l o g _ { a } m \\ + \\ l o g _ { a } n }$   \nProof: Suppose that $\\log _ { \\mathrm { a } } \\mathbf { m } = \\mathbf { x }$ and $\\mathrm { 1 o g _ { a } n = y }$   \nThen $\\mathrm { a ^ { x } = m }$ , $\\mathbf { a } ^ { \\mathrm { y } } = \\mathbf { n }$ (cid:)   \nHence $\\mathrm { { m n } = \\mathrm { { a } ^ { x } . \\mathrm { { a } ^ { y } = \\mathrm { { a } ^ { x + y } } } } }$   \nIt now follows from the definition of logarithms that   \n$\\mathrm { \\ l o g _ { a } \\ ( m n ) \\ : = \\ x + \\ y = \\ l o g _ { a } \\ m - \\ l o g _ { a } \\ n }$ (cid:) \n\nSecond Law: $\\log _ { \\mathrm { a } } { \\left( \\frac { \\mathrm { m } } { \\mathrm { n } } \\right) } = \\log _ { \\mathrm { a } } \\mathrm { ~ m ~ - ~ } \\log _ { \\mathrm { a } } \\mathrm { n }$ \n\nProof: Let $\\mathrm { 1 o g _ { a } m = x , \\ l o g _ { a } n = y }$ \n\nThen $\\mathbf { a } ^ { \\mathrm { x } } = \\mathbf { m } , \\ \\mathbf { a } ^ { \\mathrm { y } } = \\mathbf { \\Omega } \\mathbf { n }$ \n\nTherefore \n\nThird Law : $\\log _ { \\mathrm { a } } ( \\mathrm { m } ^ { \\mathrm { n } } ) = \\mathrm { ~ n ~ } \\log _ { \\mathrm { a } } \\mathrm { m }$ \n\nProof : As before, if $\\log _ { \\mathrm { a } } \\mathbf { m } = \\mathbf { x }$ then ${ \\mathrm { a } } ^ { \\mathrm { x } } = { \\mathrm { m } }$ \n\nThen $\\mathbf { m } ^ { \\mathrm { n } } = \\left( \\mathbf { a } ^ { \\mathrm { x } } \\right) ^ { \\mathrm { n } } = \\mathbf { a } ^ { \\mathrm { n x } }$ giving $\\mathrm { { l o g } _ { a } ( m ^ { n } ) = n x = n \\ l o g _ { a } \\ m }$ \n\nThus according to First Law: \"the log of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of their logs. Similarly, the Second Law says: the log of the ratio of two numbers is the diference of their logs. Thus, the use of these laws converts a problem of multiplication/division into a problem of addition/subtraction, which are far easier to perform than multiplication/division. That is why logarithms are so useful in all numerical computations. \n\nLogarithms to Base 10 \n\nBecause number 10 is the base of writing numbers, it is very convenient to use logarithms to the base 10. Some examples are: \n\n$\\log _ { 1 0 } 1 0 \\ = \\ 1 .$ ,d since $1 0 ^ { 1 } = 1 0$ $\\log _ { 1 0 } 1 0 0 = 2 ,$ (cid:) since $1 0 ^ { 2 } = 1 0 0$ (cid:) $\\log _ { 1 0 } 1 0 0 0 0 = 4$ ,d since $1 0 ^ { 4 } = 1 0 0 0 0$ $\\log _ { 1 0 } 0 . 0 1 = - 2$ ,d since $1 0 ^ { - 2 } = 0 . 0 1$ (id $\\log _ { 1 0 } { 0 . 0 0 1 } = - 3 ,$ since $1 0 ^ { - 3 } ~ = ~ 0 . 0 0 1$ and $\\log _ { 1 0 } 1 = 0$ (cid:) since $1 0 ^ { 0 } = 1$ (d) \n\nThe above results indicate that if n is an integral power of 10, i.e., 1 followed by several zeros or 1 preceded by several zeros immediately to the right of the decimal point, then log n can be easily found. \n\nIf n is not an integral power of 10, then it is not easy to calculate log n. But mathematicians have made tables from which we can read off approximate value of the logarithm of any positive number between 1 and 10. And these are suficient for us to calculate the logarithm of any number expressed in decimal form. For this purpose, we always express the given decimal as the product of an integral power of l0 and a number between 1 and io. \n\nStandard Form of Decimal \n\nwe can express any number in decimal form, as the product of (i) an integral power of 10, and (i) a number between 1 and 10. Here are some examples: \n\n(i) 25.2 lies between 10 and 100 \n\n(ii) 1038.4 lies between 1000 and 10000. \n\n(iii) 0.005 lies between 0.001 and 0.01 ： $0 . 0 0 5 = ( 0 . 0 0 5 \\times 1 0 0 0 ) \\times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } = 5 . 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$   \n(iv) 0.00025 lies between 0.0001 and 0.001 : $\\cdot \\ 0 . 0 0 0 2 5 = ( 0 . 0 0 0 2 5 \\times 1 0 0 0 0 ) \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } = 2 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ \n\nIn each case, we divide or multiply the decimal by a power of 10, to bring one non-zero digit to the left of the decimal point, and do the reverse operation by the same power of 10, indicated separately. \n\nThus, any positive decimal can be written in the form   \n$\\mathrm { ~ n ~ } = \\mathrm { ~ m ~ } \\times \\mathrm { ~ 1 0 ~ } ^ { \\mathrm { p } }$   \nwhere $\\mathrm { p }$ is an integer (positive, zero or negative) and $1 \\leq \\mathrm { m } < 1 0$ . This is called the \"standard form of n.\" \n\nWorking Rule \n\n1. Move the decimal point to the left, or to the right, as may be necessary, to bring one non-zero digit to the left of decimal point. \n\n2. (i) If you move p places to the left, multiply by $1 0 ^ { \\mathrm { p } }$ (ii If you move p places to the right, multiply by $1 0 ^ { - \\mathrm { p } }$ (ii If you do not move the decimal point at all, multiply by $1 0 ^ { \\circ }$ (iv) Write the new decimal obtained by the power of 10 (of step 2) to obtain the standard form of the given decimal. \n\nCharacteristic and Mantissa \n\nConsider the standard form of $\\mathbf { n }$   \n$\\mathrm { ~ n ~ } = \\mathrm { ~ m ~ } \\times 1 0 ^ { \\mathrm { p } }$ ,where $1 \\leq \\mathrm { m } < 1 0$   \nTaking logarithms to the base 10 and using the laws of logarithms \n\nHere p is an integer and as $1 \\leq \\mathrm { m } < 1 0$ ,s0 $0 \\leq \\log \\mathrm { ~ m ~ } < 1$ i.e., m lies between 0 and 1. When log n has been expressed as $\\mathrm { ~ p ~ + ~ l o g ~ m ~ }$ ,where $\\mathrm { p }$ is an integer and $0 \\ \\log \\mathrm { ~ m ~ } < \\ 1$ we say that $\\mathrm { p }$ is the \"characteristic\" of log n and that log m is the \"mantissa of log n. Note that characteristic is always an integer – positive, negative or zero, and mantissa is never negative and is always less than 1. If we can find the characteristics and the mantissa of log n, we have to just add them to get log n. \n\nThus to find log n, all we have to do is as follows: \n\n1. Put n in the standard form, say $\\mathrm { ~ n ~ } = \\mathrm { ~ m ~ } \\times \\ 1 0 ^ { \\mathrm { p } }$ , $1 ~ \\leq ~ \\mathrm { ~ m ~ } < 1 0$ \n\n2. Read off the characteristic $\\mathrm { p }$ of $\\log \\textbf { n }$ from this expression (exponent of 10) \n\n3. Look up log m from tables, which is being explained below. \n\n4. Write log $\\mathrm { ~ n ~ = ~ p ~ + ~ l o g ~ m ~ }$ \n\nIf the characteristic $\\mathrm { p }$ of a number n is say, 2 and the mantissa is .4133, then we have log $\\mathrm { ~ n ~ } = \\ 2$ $^ +$ .4133 which we can write as 2.4133. If, however, the characteristic p of a number m is say $- 2$ and the mantissa is .4123, then we have log $\\mathrm { ~ m ~ } { } = { } - 2 \\mathrm { ~ } { } +$ .4123. We cannot write this as -2.4123. (Why?) In order to avoid this confusion we write $\\overline { { 2 } }$ for $- 2$ and thus we write $\\log \\textrm { m } = \\textrm { \\ ' { 2 } } . 4 1 2 3$ . \n\nNow let us explain how to use the table of logarithms to find mantissas. A table is appended at the end of this Appendix. \n\nObserve that in the table, every row starts with a two digit number, 10, 11, 12,.. 97, 98, 99. Every column is headed by a one-digit number, 0, 1, 2, …..9. On the right, we have the section called \"Mean differences\" which has 9 columns headed by 1, 2...9. \n\nNow suppose we wish to find log (6.234). Then look into the row starting with 62. In this row, look at the number in the column headed by 3. The number is 7945. This means that \n\n1 $\\mathrm { ~ \\ y ~ } ( 6 . 2 3 0 ) = 0 . 7 9 4 5 ^ { \\ast }$ \n\nBut we want log (6.234). So our answer will be a litle more than 0.7945. How much more? We look this up in the section on Mean differences. Since our fourth digit is 4, look under the column headed by 4 in the Mean difference section (in the row 62). We see the number 3 there. So add 3 to 7945. We get 7948. So we finally have \n\nlog $( 6 . 2 3 4 ) \\ : = \\ : 0 . 7 9 4 8$ . \n\nTake another example. To find log (8.127), we look in the row 81 under column 2, and we find 9096. We continue in the same row and see that the mean diference under 7 is 4. Adding this to 9096, and we get 9100. So, log $( 8 . 1 2 7 ) \\ : = \\ : 0 . 9 1 0 0$ . \n\nFinding $\\pmb { N }$ when log $\\pmb { N }$ is given \n\nWe have so far discussed the procedure for finding log n when a positive number n given. We now turn to its converse i.e., to find n when log n is given and give a method for this purpose. If log $\\mathbf { n } = \\mathbf { t }$ we sometimes say $\\mathrm { ~ n ~ } =$ antilog t. Therefore our task is given t, find its antilog. For this, we use the readymade antilog tables. \n\nSuppose log $\\mathbf { n } = 2 . 5 3 7 2$ . \n\nTo find n, first take just the mantissa of log n. In this case it is .5372. (Make sure it is positive.) Now take up antilog of this number in the antilog table which is to be used exactly like the log table. In the antilog table, the entry under column 7 in the row .53 is 3443 and the mean difference for the last digit 2 in that row is 2, so the table gives 3445. Hence, \n\nantilog $( . 5 3 7 2 ) \\ : = \\ : 3 . 4 4 5$   \nNow since log $\\mathbf { \\dot { \\tau } } _ { \\mathrm { ~ n ~ } } = \\mathbf { \\dot { \\tau } } _ { \\mathrm { ~ } } 5 3 7 2$ , the characteristic of log n is 2. So the standard form of n is given by (cid:) $\\mathrm { ~ n ~ } = \\ 3 . 4 4 5 \\times \\ 1 0 ^ { 2 }$   \nor $\\mathrm { ~ n ~ } = \\ 3 4 4 . 5$ (cid:) \n\nIllustration 1: \n\nIf log $\\mathbf { x } = 1 . 0 7 1 2$ , find x. \n\nsolution: We find that the number corresponding to 0712 is 179. Since characteristic of log $x$ is 1, we have \n\nllustration 2: \n\nIf $\\log _ { 1 0 } \\textbf { x } = \\stackrel { \\textstyle } { 2 } . 1 3 5 2$ find x, \n\nsolution: From antilog tables, we find that the number corresponding to 1352 is 1366. Since the   \ncharacteristic is $\\overline { { 2 } }$ i.e., -2, so O (cid:) $\\mathbf { x } = 1 . 3 6 6 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 2 } = 0 . 0 1 3 6 6$ (cid:) \n\nUse of Logarithms in Numerical Calculations \n\nIllustration 1: Find $6 . 3 \\times 1 . 2 9$   \nSolution: Let $\\mathbf { x } = 6 . 3 \\times 1 . 2 9$ Then $\\log _ { 1 0 } { \\mathrm { ~ x ~ } } = \\log { \\ } ( 6 . 3 \\times 1 . 2 9 ) = \\log { \\ } 6 . 3 + \\log { \\ } 1 . 2 9$ Now, log $6 . 3 = 0 . 7 9 9 3$ log $1 . 2 9 \\ : = \\ : 0 . 1 1 0 6$ (cid:) ∴ $\\log _ { 1 0 } \\mathbf { \\delta x } = 0 . 9 0 9 9$ , \n\nTaking antilog (cid:) $\\mathbf { x } = 8 . 1 2 7$ Ilustration 2: Find $\\frac { { \\left( 1 . 2 3 \\right) } ^ { 1 . 5 } } { 1 1 . 2 \\times 2 3 . 5 }$ Solution: Let $\\mathbf { x } = { \\frac { ( 1 . 2 3 ) ^ { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } } { 1 1 . 2 \\times 2 3 . 5 } }$ Then log $\\mathbf { x } = \\log { \\frac { ( 1 . 2 3 ) ^ { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } } { 1 1 . 2 \\times 2 3 . 5 } }$ $\\begin{array} { l } { { = \\begin{array} { l } { { \\displaystyle { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } } } \\end{array} \\log 1 . 2 3 - \\log ( 1 1 . 2 \\times 2 3 . 5 ) } } \\\\ { { = \\begin{array} { l } { { \\displaystyle { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } } } \\end{array} \\log 1 . 2 3 - \\log 1 1 . 2 - 2 3 . 5 } } \\end{array}$ Now, log $1 . 2 3 = 0 . 0 8 9 9$ $\\frac { 3 } { 2 }$ log 1.23 = 0.13485 log $1 1 . 2 \\ : = \\ : 1 . 0 4 9 2$ (cid:) log $2 3 . 5 = 1 . 3 7 1 1$ log x = 0.13485 – 1.0492 - 1.3711 $= { \\overline { { 3 } } } . 7 1 4 5 5$ (cid:) ∴ $\\mathbf { x } = 0 . 0 0 5 1 8 3$ \n\nIllustration 3: \n\nFind $\\sqrt { \\frac { \\left( 7 1 . 2 4 \\right) ^ { 5 } \\times \\sqrt { 5 6 } } { \\left( 2 . 3 \\right) ^ { 7 } \\times \\sqrt { 2 1 } } }$ \n\nSolution: Let $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ { ~ x ~ } ~ } = \\mathrm { ~ \\sqrt { \\frac { \\left( 7 1 . 2 4 \\right) ^ { 5 } \\times \\sqrt { 5 6 } } { \\left( 2 . 3 \\right) ^ { 7 } \\times \\sqrt { 2 1 } } } }$ cid ${ \\mathrm { I h e n ~ l o g ~ x = ~ \\frac { 1 } { 2 } ~ } \\log \\left[ \\frac { \\left( 7 1 . 2 4 \\right) ^ { 5 } \\times \\sqrt { 5 6 } } { \\left( 2 . 3 \\right) ^ { 7 } \\times \\sqrt { 2 1 } } \\right] }$ 2 [1og (71.24)5 + 10g √56 − 10g (2.3)7 − 10g √21] 510g 71.24 + − 10g 56 −− 10g 2.3 −− 10g 21 2 4 2 4 \n\nNow, using log tables   \nlog $7 1 . 2 4 = 1 . 8 5 2 7$   \nlog $5 6 = 1 . 7 4 8 2$   \n(cid:) $\\log 2 . 3 = 0 . 3 6 1 7$   \n1i: $\\log 2 1 = 1 . 3 2 2 2$   \n. $\\mathrm { ~ : ~ \\log ~ } x = \\mathrm { ~ \\frac { 5 } { 2 } \\log ~ ( 1 . 8 5 2 7 ) ~ + ~ \\frac { 1 } { 4 } ~ ( 1 . 7 4 8 2 ) ~ - ~ \\frac { 7 } { 2 } ( 0 . 3 6 1 7 ) ~ - ~ \\frac { 1 } { 4 } ~ ( 1 . 8 5 2 7 ) ~ + ~ \\frac { 1 } { 2 } ~ }$ (1.3222) $= 3 . 4 7 2 3$   \n∴ $\\mathbf { x } = 2 9 6 7$ \n\nLOGARITHMS \n\nLOGARITHMS \n\nTABLE 1 (Continued) \n\nANTILOGARITHMS \n\nTABLE II \n\nANTILOGARITHMS \n\nTABLE II (Continued)",

This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). \n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. \n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calender so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children's life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. \n\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor B. L. Khandelwal for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which wil enable us to undertake further revision and refinement. \n\nNew Delhi 20 November 2006 \n\nDirector National Council of Educational Research and Training \n\nIn view of the COviD-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise. - \n\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following: \n\nOverlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class   \n● Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject   \n• Difficulty level Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning   \n● Content, which is irrelevant in the present context \n\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above. \n\nChemistry has made a profound impact on the society. It is intimately linked to the well-being of human kind. The rate of advancements in chemistry is so high that curriculum developers continuously look for strategies to cope with these advancements. Also, the students have to be inspired to be the future leaders who would make fundamental contributions. The present textbook is a sincere effort in this direction. \n\nThe structure of the textbook, presented in two parts, comprises of sixteen Units. Although the titles of various Units indicate a sort of compartmentalisation into physical, inorganic and organic chemistry, readers will find that these sub-disciplines have been intermingled, at least to a certain extent, to have a unified approach to the subject. The approach of presentation of the subject matter discourages students from rote memorisation. The subject has in fact, been organised around the laws and principles of chemistry. As students master these laws and principles, they will soon get to the point where they can predict much of what will come. \n\nEfforts have been directed towards making the subject stimulating and exciting by references to the historical developments and its usefulness to our lives, wherever appropriate. The text is well illustrated with examples from surrounding environment to facilitate grasping of the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the concept easily. Physical data are given in SI units throughout the book to make comparison of various properties easier. IUPAC system of nomenclature has been followed along with the common system. Structural formulae of chemical compounds showing functional/coordinating groups in different colours are drawn using electronic system. Each Unit has a good number of examples, as illustrations, with their solutions and some intext questions, the answers of some of which are given at the end of the Unit. The end of Unit exercises are designed to apply important principles and provoke thinking process to solve them. Answers of some of these exercises are given at the end of the book. \n\nA variety of materials, e.g., biographical sketches of some scientists, additional information related to a particular topic, etc., is given in boxes with a deep yellow coloured bar. This boxed material with a 'deep yellow bar' is to bring additional life to the topic. However, it is non-evaluative. The structures of some of the more complex compounds incorporated in the book are for understanding their chemistry. As their reproduction would lead to memorisation, it is also a non-evaluative portion of the text. \n\nThe information part has been significantly reduced and, wherever possible, it has been substantiated with facts. However, it is necessary for students to be aware of commercially important chemicals, their process of manufacture and sources of raw materials. This leads to descriptive material in the book. Attempts have been made to make descriptions of such compounds interesting by considering their structures and reactivity. Thermodynamics, kinetics and electrochemical aspects have been applied to chemical reactions which should be beneficial to students for understanding why a particular reaction happened and why a particular property is exhibited by the product. There is currently great awareness of environmental and energy issues which are directly related to chemistry. Such issues have been highlighted and dealt with at appropriate places in the book. \n\nA team of experts constituted by the NCERT has developed the manuscript of the book. It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the valuable contribution of all the members of this team. I also acknowledge the valuable and relentless contribution of the editors in bringing the book to the present shape. I also acknowledge with thanks the dedicated efforts and valuable contribution of Professor Brahm Parkash, who not only coordinated the entire programme but also actively involved in writing and editing of this book. Thanks are also due to the participating teachers and subject experts of the review workshop for their contribution, which has helped us to make the book learner friendly. Also, I thank the technical and administrative staff of the NCERT for their support in the entire process. \n\nThe team of this textbook development programme hopes that the book stimulates its readers and makes them feel the excitement and fascination for this subject. Efforts have been made to bring out this book error-free. Nevertheless, it is recognised that in such a book of complexity, there could inevitably be occasional errors. It will always be a pleasure to hear about them from readers to take necessary steps to rectify them. \n\nCHAIRmAN， ADVISORY GROUP FOR TExTBOOKS IN ScIENCE AND MATHEMATICS\n\nJ.V.

    "content": "Objctives \n\nAfter studying this Unit, you will be able to \n\nname haloalkanes and haloarenes according to the IUPAC system of nomenclature from their given structures;   \ndescribe the reactions involved in the preparation of haloalkanes and haloarenes and understand various reactions that they undergo;   \n● correlate the structures of haloalkanes and haloarenes with various types of reactions;   \n● use stereochemistry as a tool for understanding the reaction mechanism;   \nappreciate the applications of organo-metallic compounds; highlight the environmental effects of polyhalogen compounds. \n\nHalogenated compounds persist in the environment due to their resistance to breakdown by soil bacteria. \n\nThe replacement of hydrogen atom(s) in an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon by halogen atom(s) results in the formation of alkyl halide (haloalkane) and aryl halide (haloarene), respectively. Haloalkanes contain halogen atom(s) attached to the $s p ^ { 3 }$ hybridised carbon atom of an alkyl group whereas haloarenes contain halogen atom(s) attached to $s p ^ { 2 }$ hybridised carbon atom(s) of an aryl group. Many halogen containing organic compounds occur in nature and some of these are clinically useful. These classes of compounds find wide applications in industry as well as in dayto-day life. They are used as solvents for relatively non-polar compounds and as starting materials for the synthesis of wide range of organic compounds. Chlorine containing antibiotic, chloramphenicol, produced by microorganisms is very effective for the treatment of typhoid fever. Our body produces iodine containing hormone, thyroxine, the deficiency of which causes a disease called goiter. Synthetic halogen compounds, viz. chloroquine is used for the treatment of malaria; halothane is used as an anaesthetic during surgery. Certain fully fluorinated compounds are being considered as potential blood substitutes in surgery. \n\nIn this Unit, you will study the important methods of preparation, physical and chemical properties and uses of organohalogen compounds. \n\nHaloalkanes and haloarenes may be classified as follows: \n\n6.1.1 On the Basis of Number of Halogen Atoms \n\nThese may be classified as mono, di, or polyhalogen (tri-,tetra-, etc.) compounds depending on whether they contain one, two or more halogen atoms in their structures. For example, \n\nC2H{X CHX CHX CH2X   \nMonohaloalkane Dihaloalkane Trihaloalkane X X X   \nMonohaloarene Dihaloarene Trihaloarene \n\nMonohalocompounds may further be classified according to the hybridisation of the carbon atom to which the halogen is bonded, as discussed below. ▲ \n\n6.1.2 Compounds Containing (cid:) $\\scriptstyle \\pmb { s p } ^ { 3 } \\mathbf { C } - \\mathbf { X }$ (cid:) Bond $[ \\mathbb { X } = \\mathbb { F } ,$ C1, Br, I) \n\nThis class includes \n\n(a) Alkyl halides or haloalkanes (R—x) \n\nIn alkyl halides, the halogen atom is bonded to an alkyl group $\\textstyle ( \\mathrm { R } )$ . They form a homologous series represented by $\\mathrm { C } _ { \\mathrm { n } } \\mathrm { H } _ { { 2 \\mathrm { n } } + 1 } \\mathrm { X } .$ further classified as primary, secondary or tertiary according to the nature of carbon to which halogen is attached. If halogen is attached to a primary carbon atom in an alkyl halide, the alkyl halide is called primary alkyl halide or $1 ^ { \\circ }$ alkyl halide. Similarly, if halogen is attached to secondary or tertiary carbon atom, the alkyl halide is called secondary alkyl halide $( 2 ^ { \\circ } )$ and tertiary $( 3 ^ { \\circ } )$ alkyl halide, respectively. \n\nR' 1X R\"− R\"−C-X H R\"   \nPrimary (1%) Secondary $( 2 ^ { \\circ } )$ (cid:) Tertiary $( 3 ^ { \\circ } )$ \n\n(b) Allylic halides \n\nThese are the compounds in which the halogen atom is bonded to an $s p ^ { 3 }$ -hybridised carbon atom adjacent to carbon-carbon double bond (cid:) $\\scriptstyle ( \\mathbf { C } = \\mathbf { C } )$ i.e. to an allylic carbon. \n\n(c) Benzylic halides \n\nThese are the compounds in which the halogen atom is bonded to an $s p ^ { 3 } .$ -hybridised carbon atom attached to an aromatic ring. \n\n6.1.3 Compounds Containing sp²C—x Bond \n\nThis class includes: \n\n(a) Vinylic halides \n\nThese are the compounds in which the halogen atom is bonded to a $s p ^ { 2 }$ -hybridised carbon atom of a carbon-carbon double bond \n\n$\\left( \\mathbf { C } = \\mathbf { C } \\right)$ . \n\n(b) Aryl halides \n\nThese are the compounds in which the halogen atom is directly bonded to the $s p ^ { 2 }$ -hybridised carbon atom of an aromatic ring. \n\nHaving learnt the classification of halogenated compounds, let us now learn how these are named. The common names of alkyl halides are derived by naming the alkyl group followed by the name of halide. In the IUPAC system of nomenclature, alkyl halides are named as halosubstituted hydrocarbons. For mono halogen substituted derivatives of benzene, common and IUPAC names are the same. For dihalogen derivatives, the prefixes $o \\mathrm { - }$ ,m-, $p$ are used in common system but in IUPAC system, as you have learnt in Class XI, the numerals 1,2; 1,3 and 1,4 are used. \n\nCH3CH2CH2Br \n\nH₃C-CH-CH3 c1 \n\nCH3 H3C-CH-CH2C1 Isobutyl chloride 1-Chloro-2-methylpropane \n\nCommon name: n-Propyl bromide IUPAC name: 1-Bromopropane \n\nIsopropyl chloride 2-Chloropropane \n\nCommon name: Bromobenzene IUPAC name: Bromobenzene $m$ -Dibromobenzene 1,3-Dibromobenzene sym-Tribromobenzene 1,3,5-Tribromobenzene \n\nIUPAC name: \n\n1-Chloro-2,2-dimethylpropane \n\nThe dihaloalkanes having the same type of halogen atoms are named as alkylidene or alkylene dihalides. The dihalo-compounds having both the halogen atoms are further classified as geminal halides or gem-dihalides when both the halogen atoms are present on the same carbon atom of the chain and vicinal halides or vic-dihalides when halogen atoms are present on adjacent carbon atoms. In common name system, gem-dihalides are named as alkylidene halides and vic-dihalides are named as alkylene dihalides. In IUPAC system, they are named as dihaloalkanes. \n\nCommon name: Ethylidene chloride (gem-dihalide) \n\nEthylene dichloride (vic-dihalide) \n\nIUPAC name: 1, 1-Dichloroethane \n\n1, 2-Dichloroethane \n\nome common examples of halocompounds are mentioned in Table 6.1. \n\nExample 6.1 \n\nDraw the structures of all the eight structural isomers that have the molecular formula $\\mathrm { C _ { 5 } H _ { 1 1 } B r }$ .

Fluorine atom is the smallest and iodine atom is the largest. Consequently the carbon-halogen bond length also increases from C—F to C—I. Some typical bond lengths, bond enthalpies and dipole moments are given in Table 6.2. \n\nAlkyl halides are best prepared from alcohols, which are easily accessible. \n\n6.4 Methods of Preparation of Haloalkanes \n\n6.4.1 From Alcohols \n\nThe hydroxyl group of an alcohol is replaced by halogen on reaction with concentrated halogen acids, phosphorus halides or thionyl chloride. Thionyl chloride is preferred because in this reaction alkyl halide is formed along with gases ${ \\mathsf { S O } } _ { 2 }$ and HCl. The two gaseous products are escapable, hence, the reaction gives pure alkyl halides. The reactions of primary and secondary alcohols with HCl require the presence of a catalyst, $\\mathrm { z n C l } _ { 2 }$ . With tertiary alcohols, the reaction is conducted by simply shaking the alcohol with concentrated HCl at room temperature. Constant boiling with HBr $( 4 8 \\% )$ is used for preparing alkyl bromide. Good yields of R—I may be obtained by heating alcohols with sodium or potassium iodide in $9 5 \\%$ orthophosphoric acid. The order of reactivity of alcohols with a given haloacid is $3 ^ { \\circ } { > } 2 ^ { \\circ } { > } 1 ^ { \\circ }$ . Phosphorus tribromide and triiodide are usually generated in situ (produced in the reaction mixture) by the reaction of red phosphorus with bromine and iodine respectively. \n\nThe preparation of alkyl chloride is carried out either by passing dry hydrogen chloride gas through a solution of alcohol or by heating a mixture of alcohol and concentrated aqueous halogen acid. \n\nThe above methods are not applicable for the preparation of aryl halides because the carbon-oxygen bond in phenols has a partial double bond character and is difficult to break being stronger than a single bond. \n\n(I) From alkanes by free radical halogenation \n\nFree radical chlorination or bromination of alkanes gives a complex mixture of isomeric mono- and polyhaloalkanes, which is difficult to \n\nseparate as pure compounds. Consequently, the yield of any single compound is low. \n\n(I) From alkenes \n\n(i) Addition of hydrogen halides: An alkene is converted to corresponding alkyl halide by reaction with hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide or hydrogen iodide. \n\nPropene yields two products, however only one predominates as per Markovnikov's rule. (Unit 13, Class XI) \n\nminor major \n\n(ii) Addition of halogens: In the laboratory, addition of bromine in $\\mathrm { C C l } _ { 4 }$ to an alkene resulting in discharge of reddish brown colour of bromine constitutes an important method for the detection of double bond in a molecule. The addition results in the synthesis of vic-dibromides, which are colourless (Unit 9, Class XI). \n\nIdentify all the possible monochloro structural isomers expected to be formed on free radical monochlorination of $\\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } C H C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 3 } }$ \n\nExample 6.3 \n\nIn the given molecule, there are four different types of hydrogen atoms. Replacement of these hydrogen atoms will give the following \n\nSolution \n\n(CH)2CHCH2CH2C1 (CH)2,CHCH(C1)CH(CH)2C(C1)CH2CH3 CH_CH(CH2C1)CH2CH\n\n6.4.3 Halogen Exchange \n\nAlkyl iodides are often prepared by the reaction of alkyl chlorides/ bromides with NaI in dry acetone. This reaction is known as Finkelstein reaction. \n\nNaCl or NaBr thus formed is precipitated in dry acetone. It facilitates the forward reaction according to Le Chatelier's Principle. \n\nThe synthesis of alkyl fluorides is best accomplished by heating an alkyl chloride/bromide in the presence of a metallic fluoride such as \n\nAgF, $\\mathrm { H g } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ , $\\mathrm { C o F _ { 2 } }$ or $\\mathrm { S b F _ { 3 } }$ . The reaction is termed as Swarts reaction. \n\nFrom hydrocarbons by electrophilic substitution \n\nAryl chlorides and bromides can be easily prepared by electrophilic substitution of arenes with chlorine and bromine respectively in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts like iron or iron(Ill) chloride. \n\nThe ortho and para isomers can be easily separated due to large difference in their melting points. Reactions with iodine are reversible in nature and require the presence of an oxidising agent $\\mathrm { ( H N O _ { 3 } }$ , $\\mathrm { H I O _ { 4 } } )$ to oxidise the HI formed during iodination. Fluoro compounds are not prepared by this method due to high reactivity of fluorine. \n\n(ii) From amines by Sandmeyer's reaction \n\nWhen a primary aromatic amine, dissolved or suspended in cold aqueous mineral acid, is treated with sodium nitrite, a diazonium salt is formed. Mixing the solution of freshly prepared diazonium salt with cuprous chloride or cuprous bromide results in the replacement of the diazonium group by $- \\mathbf { C l }$ or $- \\mathrm { B r }$ \n\nReplacement of the diazonium group by iodine does not require the presence of cuprous halide and is done simply by shaking the diazonium salt with potassium iodide. \n\nExample 6.4 Write the products of the following reactions: \n\n6.2 Why is sulphuric acid not used during the reaction of alcohols with KI? \n\n6.3 Write structures of different dihalogen derivatives of propane. \n\n6.4 Among the isomeric alkanes of molecular formula $\\mathrm { C } _ { 5 } \\mathrm { H } _ { 1 2 }$ identify the one that on photochemical chlorination yields \n\n(i) A single monochloride.   \n(ii) Three isomeric monochlorides.   \n(i) Four isomeric monochlorides. \n\n6.5 Draw the structures of major monohalo products in each of the following reactions: - \n\n(i) +sOCl boe (i d CH.CH t r(ii) CH,0HC heat (iv) CH\\$ HI—OH(v) CH₃CH2Br + NaI (vi) + Br2\n\nAlkyl halides are colourless when pure. However, bromides and iodides develop colour when exposed to light. Many volatile halogen compounds have sweet smell. \n\nMelting and boiling points \n\nMethyl chloride, methyl bromide, ethyl chloride and some chlorofluoromethanes are gases at room temperature. Higher members are liquids or solids. As we have already learnt, molecules of organic halogen compounds are generally polar. Due to greater polarity as well as higher molecular mass as compared to the parent hydrocarbon, the intermolecular forces of attraction (dipole-dipole and van der Waals) are stronger in the halogen derivatives. That is why the boiling points of chlorides, bromides and iodides are considerably higher than those of the hydrocarbons of comparable molecular mass. \n\nThe attractions get stronger as the molecules get bigger in size and have more electrons. The pattern of variation of boiling points of different halides is depicted in Fig. 6.1. For the same alkyl group, the boiling points of alkyl halides decrease in the order: RI> RBr> RCl> RF. This is because with the increase in size and mass of halogen atom, the magnitude of van der Waal forces increases. \n\nThe boiling points of isomeric haloalkanes decrease with increase in branching. For example, 2-bromo-2-methylpropane has the lowest boiling point among the three isomers. \n\nCH3 CH3CH2CH2CH2Br CH3CH2CHCH3 H3C-C-CH3 Br Br b.p./K 375 364 346 \n\nBoiling points of isomeric dihalobenzenes are very nearly the same. However, the para-isomers are high melting as compared to their orthoand meta-isomers. It is due to symmetry of para-isomers that fits in crystal lattice better as compared to ortho- and meta-isomers. \n\nDensity \n\nBromo, iodo and polychloro derivatives of hydrocarbons are heavier than water. The density increases with increase in number of carbon atoms, halogen atoms and atomic mass of the halogen atoms (Table 6.3). \n\nSolubility \n\nThe haloalkanes are very slightly soluble in water: In order to dissolve haloalkane in water, energy is required to overcome the attractions between the haloalkane molecules and break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Less energy is released when new attractions are set up between the haloalkane and the water molecules as these are not as strong as the original hydrogen bonds in water. As a result, the solubility of haloalkanes in water is low. However, haloalkanes tend to dissolve in organic solvents because the new intermolecular attractions between haloalkanes and solvent molecules have much the same strength as the ones being broken in the separate haloalkane and solvent molecules. \n\nIntext Question \n\n6.6 Arrange each set of compounds in order of increasing boiling points. \n\n(i) Bromomethane, Bromoform, Chloromethane, Dibromome (ii) 1-Chloropropane, Isopropyl chloride, 1-Chlorobutane. \n\n6.7 Chemical Reactions \n\n6.7.1 Reactions of Haloalkanes \n\nThe reactions of haloalkanes may be divided into the following categories: \n\n1. Nucleophilic substitution   \n2. Elimination reactions   \n3. Reaction with metals. \n\n(1)Nucleophilic substitution reactions \n\nYou have learnt in Class XI that nucleophiles are electron rich species. Therefore, they attack at that part of the substrate molecule which is electron deficient. The reaction in which a nucleophile replaces already existing nucleophile in a molecule is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. Haloalkanes are substrate in these reactions. In this type of reaction, a nucleophile reacts with haloalkane (the substrate) having a partial positive charge on the carbon atom bonded to halogen. A substitution reaction takes place and halogen atom, called leaving group departs as halide ion. Since the substitution reaction is initiated by a nucleophile, it is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. \n\nIt is one of the most useful classes of organic reactions of alkyl halides in which halogen is bonded to $s p ^ { 3 }$ hybridised carbon. The products formed by the reaction of haloalkanes with some common nucleophiles are given in Table 6.4. \n\nGroups like cyanides and nitrites possess two nucleophilic centres and are called ambident nucleophiles. Actually cyanide group is a hybrid of two contributing structures and therefore can act as a nucleophile in two different ways $[ ^ { \\circ } \\mathbf { C } \\equiv \\mathbf { N }  \\mathrel { \\mathop : } \\mathbf { C } = \\mathbf { N } ^ { \\ominus } ]$ , i.e., linking through \n\nHaloalkanes react with KCN to form alkyl cyanides as main product while AgCN forms isocyanides as the chief product. Explain. \n\nKCN is predominantly ionic and provides cyanide ions in solution. Although both carbon and nitrogen atoms are in a position to donate electron pairs, the attack takes place mainly through carbon atom and not through nitrogen atom since C—C bond is more stable than C—N bond. However, $\\mathbf { A g C N }$ is mainly covalent in nature and nitrogen is free to donate electron pair forming isocyanide as the main product. \n\nExcample 6.5 \n\ncarbon atom resulting in alkyl cyanides and through nitrogen atom leading to isocyanides. Similarly nitrite ion also represents an ambident nucleophile with two different points of linkage $[ \\mathrm { - O - N = O } ]$ . The linkage through oxygen results in alkyl nitrites while through nitrogen atom, it leads to nitroalkanes. - \n\nMechanism: This reaction has been found to proceed by two different mechanims which are described below: \n\n(a) Substitution nucleophilic bimolecular (S/2) \n\nThe reaction between $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C l }$ and hydroxide ion to yield methanol and chloride ion follows a second order kinetics, i.e., the rate depends upon the concentration of both the reactants. \n\nH H δ OH + C1 HO HO + Cl H H H H H \n\nThe solid wedge represents the bond coming out of the paper, dashed line going down the paper and a straight line representing bond in the plane of the paper. \n\nThe above reaction can be represented diagrammatically as shown in Fig. 6.2. \n\nIn the year 1937, Edward Davies Hughes and Sir Christopher Ingold proposed a mechanism for an $S _ { \\scriptscriptstyle N } { 2 }$ reaction. \n\nIt depicts a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution $\\mathrm { ( S } _ { \\mathrm { v } } \\mathrm { 2 ) }$ reaction; the incoming nucleophile interacts with alkyl halide causing the carbon-halide bond to break and a new bond is formed between carbon and attacking nucleophile. Here it is C-O bond formed between C and -OH. These two processes take place simultaneously in a single step and no intermediate is formed. As the reaction progresses and the bond between the incoming nucleophile and the carbon atom starts forming, the bond between carbon atom and leaving group weakens. As this happens, the three carbon-hydrogen bonds of the substrate start moving away from the attacking nucleophile. In transition state all the three C-H bonds are in the same plane and the attacking and leaving nucleophiles are partially attached to the carbon. As the attacking nucleophile approaches closer to the carbon, C-H bonds still keep on moving in the same direction till the attacking nucleophile attaches to carbon and leaving group leaves the carbon. As a result configuration is inverted, the configuration (See box) of carbon atom under attack inverts in much the same way as an umbrella is turned inside out when caught in a strong wind. This process is called as inversion of configuration. In the transition state, the carbon atom is simultaneously bonded to incoming nucleophile and the outgoing leaving group. Such structures are unstable and cannot be isolated. Thus, in the transition state, carbon is simultaneously bonded to five atoms. \n\nConfiguration \n\nSpacial arrangement of functional groups around carbon is called its configuration.   \nSee the structures (A) and (B) given below carefully. \n\nMirror Br C H\\` C1 C1 'H I I (A) (B) \n\nThese are the two structures of the same compound. They differ in spacial arrangement of functional groups attached to carbon. Structure (A) is mirror image of Structure (B). We say configuration of carbon in structure (A) is mirror image of the configuration of carbon in structure (B). \n\nHughes worked under Ingold and earned a D.Sc. degree from the University of London. \n\nSince this reaction requires the approach of the nucleophile to the carbon bearing the leaving group, the presence of bulky substituents on or near the carbon atom have a dramatic inhibiting effect. Of the simple alkyl halides, methyl halides react most rapidly in $\\mathrm { \\mathsf { S } } _ { \\mathrm { N } } 2$ reactions because there are only three small hydrogen atoms. Tertiary halides are the least reactive because bulky groups hinder the approaching nucleophiles. Thus the order of reactivity followed is: Primary halide $>$ Secondary halide $>$ Tertiary halide. \n\n(b) Substitution nucleophilic unimolecular $( S _ { N } I )$ \n\n$\\mathbf { S } _ { \\mathrm { N } } \\mathbf { 1 }$ reactions are generally carried out in polar protic solvents (like water, alcohol, acetic acid, etc.). The reaction between tertbutyl bromide and hydroxide ion yields tert-butyl alcohol and follows the first order kinetics, i.e., the rate of reaction depends upon the concentration of only one reactant, which is tert- butyl bromide. \n\n(CHg)3CBr OH (CH₃)₃COH + Br2-Bromo-2-methylpropane 2-Methylpropan-2-01 \n\nIt occurs in two steps. In step I, the polarised C—Br bond undergoes slow cleavage to produce a carbocation and a bromide ion. The carbocation thus formed is then attacked by nucleophile in step II to complete the substitution reaction. \n\nStep I is the slowest and reversible. It involves the C-Br bond breaking for which the energy is obtained through solvation of halide ion with the proton of protic solvent. Since the rate of reaction depends upon the slowest step, the rate of reaction depends only on the concentration of alkyl halide and not on the concentration of hydroxide ion. Further, greater the stability of carbocation, greater wil be its ease of formation from alkyl halide and faster will be the rate of reaction. In case of alkyl halides, $3 ^ { 0 }$ alkyl halides undergo $\\mathbf { S } _ { \\mathrm { N } } \\mathbf { 1 }$ reaction very fast because of the high stability of $3 ^ { 0 }$ carbocations. we can sum up the order of reactivity of alkyl halides towards $\\mathbf { S } _ { \\mathrm { N } } \\mathbf { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { S } _ { \\mathrm { N } } 2$ reactions as follows: \n\nFor $\\mathrm { S } _ { \\mathrm { v } } 2$ reaction \n\nTertiary halide; Secondary halide; Primary halide; $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } X }$ \n\nFor SNl reaction \n\nFor the same reasons, allylic and benzylic halides show high reactivity towards the $\\mathbf { S } _ { \\mathrm { N } } \\mathbf { 1 }$ reaction. The carbocation thus formed gets stabilised through resonance (Unit 8, Class XI) as shown below: - \n\nFor a given alkyl group, the reactivity of the halide, R-X, follows the same order in both the mechanisms R-I> R-Br>R-Cl>>R-F. \n\nIn the following pairs of halogen compounds, which would undergo Example 6.6 $\\mathrm { \\mathsf { S } } _ { \\mathrm { N } } \\mathrm { \\mathsf { 2 } }$ reaction faster? \n\n− CH2Cl and \n\nIt is primary halide and therefore undergoes S2 reaction faster. \n\nAs iodine is a better leaving group because of its large size, it will be released at a faster rate in the presence of incoming nucleophile. \n\nSolution \n\nPredict the order of reactivity of the following compounds in $\\mathsf { S } _ { \\mathrm { v } } 1$ and $\\mathrm { \\mathsf { S } } _ { \\mathrm { N } } 2$ reactions: \n\nExcample 6.7 \n\n(i) The four isomeric bromobutanes (i) $\\mathrm { C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } C H _ { 2 } B r }$ $\\mathrm { C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } C H ( C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } ) B r }$ , $\\mathrm { C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } C H ( C H _ { 3 } ) B r }$ , C HgC(CH)(C Hg)Br \n\nSolution (i) $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 2 } B r } < \\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } C H C H _ { 2 } B r } < \\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C H _ { 2 } C H ( B r ) C H _ { 3 } } < \\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } C B r }$ $( \\mathsf { S } _ { \\mathrm { v } } \\mathrm { 1 } )$ (cid:) (cid:) $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 2 } B r } > \\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } C H C H _ { 2 } B r } > \\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C H _ { 2 } C H ( B r ) C H _ { 3 } } > \\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } C B r } \\mathrm { ( S _ { \\mathrm { { N } } } 2 ) }$ \n\nOf the two primary bromides, the carbocation intermediate derived from $\\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } C H C H _ { 2 } B r }$ is more stable than derived from $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 2 } B r }$ because of greater electron donating inductive effect of $\\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } C H - }$ group. Therefore, $\\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } C H C H _ { 2 } B r }$ is more reactive than $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 2 } B r }$ in $\\mathbf { S } _ { \\mathrm { N } } \\mathbf { 1 }$ reactions. $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C H _ { 2 } C H ( B r ) C H _ { 3 } }$ is a secondary bromide and $\\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } C B r }$ is a tertiary bromide. Hence the above order is followed in $\\mathbf { S } _ { \\mathrm { N } } \\mathbf { 1 }$ . The reactivity in $\\mathrm { S } _ { \\mathrm { N } } 2$ reactions follows the reverse order as the steric hinderance around the electrophilic carbon increases in that order. \n\nWilliam Nicol (1768- 1851) developed the first prism that produced plane polarised light. \n\n$\\mathrm { C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } C ( C H _ { 3 } ) ( C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } ) B r < C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } C H ( C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } ) B r < \\mathrm { C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } C H ( C H _ { 3 } ) B r < C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } C H _ { 2 } B r ( S _ { 8 } 2 ) } }$ Of the two secondary bromides, the carbocation intermediate obtained from $\\mathrm { C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } C H ( C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } ) B r }$ is more stable than obtained from $\\mathrm { C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } C H ( C H _ { 3 } ) B r }$ because it is stabilised by two phenyl groups due to resonance. Therefore, the former bromide is more reactive than the latter in $\\mathsf { S } _ { \\mathrm { v } } \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ reactions. A phenyl group is bulkier than a methyl group. Therefore, $\\mathrm { \\dot { C } _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } C H ( C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } ) B r }$ is less reactive than $\\mathrm { C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } C H ( C H _ { 3 } ) B r }$ in $\\mathrm { \\mathsf { S } } _ { \\mathrm { N } } 2$ reactions. \n\n(c) Stereochemical aspects of nucleophilic substitution reactions In order to understand the stereochemical aspects of substitution reactions, we need to learn some basic stereochemical principles and notations (optical activity, chirality, retention, inversion, racemisation, etc.). \n\n(i) Optical activity: Plane of plane polarised light produced by passing ordinary light through Nicol prism is rotated when it is passed through the solutions of certain compounds. Such compounds are called optically active compounds. The angle by which the plane polarised light is rotated is measured by an instrument called polarimeter. If the compound rotates the plane of plane polarised light to the right, i.e., clockwise direction, it is called dextrorotatory (Greek for right rotating) or the $d$ -form and is indicated by placing a positive $( + )$ sign before the degree of rotation. If the light is rotated towards left (anticlockwise direction), the compound is said to be laevo-rotatory or the l-form and a negative $\\left( - \\right)$ sign is placed before the degree of rotation. Such $( + )$ and $\\left( - \\right)$ isomers of a compound are called optical isomers and the phenomenon is termed as optical isomerism. \n\n(i) Molecular asymmetry, chirality and enantiomers: The observation of Louis Pasteur (1848) that crystals of certain compounds exist in the form of mirror images laid the foundation of modern stereochemistry. He demonstrated that aqueous solutions of both types of crystals showed optical rotation, equal in magnitude (for solution of equal concentration) but opposite in direction. He believed that this difference in optical activity was associated with the three dimensional arrangements of atoms in the molecules (configurations) of \n\nJacobus Hendricus Van't Hoff (1852-1911) received the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1901 for his work on solutions. \n\ntwo types of crystals. Dutch scientist, J. Van't Hoff and French scientist, C. Le Bel in the same year (1874), independently argued that the spatial arrangement of four groups (valencies) around a central carbon is tetrahedral and if all the substituents attached to that carbon are different, the mirror image of the molecule is not superimposed (overlapped) on the molecule; such a carbon is called asymmetric carbon or stereocentre. The resulting molecule would lack symmetry and is referred to as asymmetric molecule. The asymmetry of the molecule along with non superimposability of mirror images is responsible for the optical activity in such organic compounds. \n\nThe symmetry and asymmetry are also observed in many day to day objects: a sphere, a cube, a cone, are all identical to their mirror images and can be superimposed. However, many objects are non superimposable on their mirror images. For example, your left and right hand look similar but if you put your left hand on your right hand by moving them in the same plane, they do not coincide. The objects which are nonsuperimposable on their mirror image (like a pair of hands) are said to be chiral and this property is known as chirality. Chiral molecules are optically active, while the objects, which are, superimposable on their mirror images are called achiral. These molecules are optically inactive. \n\nThe above test of molecular chirality can be applied to organic molecules by constructing models and its mirror images or by drawing three dimensional structures and attempting to superimpose them in our minds. There are other aids, however, that can assist us in recognising chiral molecules. One such aid is the presence of a single asymmetric carbon atom. Let us consider two simple molecules propan-2-ol (Fig.6.5) and butan-2-ol (Fig.6.6) and their mirror images. \n\nAs you can see very clearly, propan-2-ol (A) does not contain an asymmetric carbon, as all the four groups attached to the tetrahedral carbon are not different. We rotate the mirror image $\\mathrm { ( B ) }$ of the molecule by $1 8 0 ^ { \\circ }$ (structure C) and try to overlap the structure (C) with the structure (A), these structures completely overlap. Thus propan-2-ol is an achiral molecule. \n\nButan-2-ol has four different groups attached to the tetrahedral carbon and as expected is chiral. Some common examples of chiral molecules such as 2-chlorobutane, 2, 3-dihyroxypropanal,(OHC-CHOH- $\\mathrm { { C H } _ { 2 } O H ) }$ , bromochloro-iodomethane (BrClCHI), 2-bromopropanoic acid (cd $\\mathrm { H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { C } \\cdot$ —CHBr–COOH), etc. \n\nThe stereoisomers related to each other as nonsuperimposable mirror images are called enantiomers (Fig. 6.7). A and B in Fig. 6.5 and D and E in Fig. 6.6 are enantiomers. \n\nEnantiomers possess identical physical properties namely, melting point, boiling point, refractive index, etc. They only diff er with respect to the rotation of plane polarised light. If one of the enantiomer is dextro rotatory, the other will be laevo rotatory. \n\nHowever, the sign of optical rotation is not necessarily related to the absolute (actual) configuration of the molecule. \n\nA mixture containing two enantiomers in equal proportions will have zero optical rotation, as the rotation due to one isomer will be cancelled by the rotation due to the other isomer. Such a mixture is known as racemic mixture or racemic modification. A racemic mixture is represented by prefixing dl or $\\left( \\pm \\right)$ before the name, for example $\\left( \\pm \\right)$ butan-2-ol. The process of conversion of enantiomer into a racemic mixture is known as racemisation. \n\nExample 6.8 \n\nIdentify chiral and achiral molecules in each of the following pair of compounds. (Wedge and Dash representations according to Class XI. \n\n(ii) CH₃CHCH2CH3 CH₃CH2CH2CH₂Br Br (i) (ii) \n\n(ii) Retention: Retention of configuration is the preservation of the spatial arrangement of bonds to an asymmetric centre during a chemical reaction or transformation. \n\nIn general, if during a reaction, no bond to the stereocentre is broken, the product will have the same general configuration of groups around the stereocentre as that of reactant. Such a reaction is said to proceed with retention of the configuration. Consider as an example, the reaction that takes place when (-)-2-methylbutan-1-ol is heated with concentrated hydrochloric acid. \n\nHCH2−i-OH CH_\\$ + H-CI heat HiCH₂−1-C1 CH3 +H-OH   \nCH _\\$ CH2 CH₃ 人 CH3   \n(-)-2-Methylbutan-1-ol (+)-1-Chloro-2-methylbutane \n\nIt is important to note that configuration at a symmetric centre in the reactant and product is same but the sign of optical rotation has changed in the product. This is so because two different compounds with same configuration at asymmetric centre may have different optical rotation. One may be dextrorotatory (plus sign of optical rotation) while other may be laevorotatory (negative sign of optical rotation). \n\n(iv) Inversion, retention and racemisation: There are three outcomes for a reaction at an asymmetric carbon atom, when a bond directly linked to an asymmetric carbon atom is broken. Consider the replacement of a group X by Y in the following reaction; \n\nIf (A) is the only compound obtained, the process is called retention of configuration. Note that configuration has been rotated in A. If (B) is the only compound obtained, the process is called inversion of configuration. Configuration has been inverted in B. \n\nIf a 50:50 mixture of A and B is obtained then the process is called racemisation and the product is optically inactive, as one isomer will rotate the plane polarised light in the direction opposite to another. \n\nNow let us have a fresh look at $\\mathbf { S _ { \\mathbf { N } } } \\mathbf { 1 }$ and $\\mathbf { S _ { N } 2 }$ mechanisms by taking examples of optically active alkyl halides. \n\nIn case of optically active alkyl halides, the product formed as a result of $\\mathrm { S } _ { \\mathrm { N } } 2$ mechanism has the inverted configuration as compared to the reactant. This is because the nucleophile attaches itself on the side opposite to the one where the halogen atom is present. when $\\left( - \\right)$ -2-bromooctane is allowed to react with sodium hydroxide, (cid:) $( + )$ -octan-2-ol is formed with the -OH group occupying the position opposite to what bromide had occupied. \n\nThus, $\\mathrm { \\mathsf { S } } _ { \\mathrm { N } } 2$ reactions of optically active halides are accompanied by inversion of configuration. \n\nIn case of optically active alkyl halides, $\\mathrm { S } _ { \\mathrm { N } } 1$ reactions are accompanied by racemisation. Can you think of the reason why it happens? Actually the carbocation formed in the slow step being $\\dot { s p } ^ { 2 }$ hybridised is planar (achiral). The attack of the nucleophile may be accomplished from either side of the plane of carbocation resulting in a mixture of products, one having the same configuration (the $- \\mathrm { O H }$ \n\nCHg HC Br CH2CH3 + HCH2C NCH repuL   \nHO HO H (, OH → H   \n+)-Butan-2-0l hè 人-OH (-)Butan-2-0l \n\nLocation of a and $\\beta$ carbon in a molecule \n\nCarbon on which halogen atom is directly attached is called $\\alpha$ -carbon and the carbon atom adjacent to this carbon is called $\\beta$ -carbon. \n\nattaching on the same position as halide ion) and the other having opposite configuration (the –OH attaching on the side opposite to halide ion). This may be illustrated by hydrolysis of optically active 2-bromobutane, which results in the formation of $\\left( \\pm \\right)$ -butan-2-0l. \n\n2. Elimination reactions \n\nwhen a haloalkane with $\\beta$ -hydrogen atom is heated with alcoholic solution of potassium hydroxide, there is elimination of hydrogen atom from $\\beta$ -carbon and a halogen atom from the $\\alpha$ -carbon atom. \n\nAs a result, an alkene is formed as a product. Since $\\beta$ -hydrogen atom is involved in elimination, it is often called $\\beta$ -elimination. \n\nIf there is possibility of formation of more than one alkene due to the availability of more than one $\\beta$ -hydrogen atoms, usually one alkene is formed as the major product. These form part of a pattern first observed by Russian chemist, Alexander Zaitsev (also pronounced as Saytzeff) who in 1875 formulated a rule which can be summarised as \"in dehydrohalogenation reactions, the preferred product is that alkene which has the greater number of alkyl groups attached to the doubly bonded carbon atoms.\" Thus, 2-bromopentane gives pent-2-ene as the major product. \n\nBrH₂C-CH₂-CH=CH-CH←OH H₂C-CH₂−CH2−CH-CH2 -OH ≥ H₃C-CH2-CH₂-CH=CH2HPent-2-ene (81%) 2-Bromopentane Pent-l-ene (19%)\n\nElimination versus substitution \n\nA chemical reaction is the result of competition; it is a race that is won by the fastest runner. A collection of molecules tend to do, by and large, what is easiest for them. An alkyl halide with $\\beta$ -hydrogen atoms when reacted with a base or a nucleophile has two competing routes: substitution $( \\mathsf { S } _ { \\mathrm { v } } \\mathsf { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { \\ S _ { N } } 2 )$ and elimination. which route will be taken up depends upon the nature of alkyl halide, strength and size of base/nucleophile and reaction conditions. Thus, a bulkier nucleophile will prefer to act as a base and abstracts a proton rather than approach a tetravalent carbon atom (steric reasons) and vice versa. Similarly, a primary alkyl halide will prefer a $\\mathrm { \\mathsf { S } } _ { \\mathrm { N } } 2$ reaction, a secondary halide- $\\mathrm { \\mathsf { S } } _ { \\mathrm { v } } \\mathrm { } ^ { 2 }$ or elimination depending upon the strength of base/nucleophile and a tertiary halide- $\\mathbf { S } _ { \\mathrm { v } } \\mathbf { 1 }$ or elimination depending upon the stability of carbocation or the more substituted alkene. \n\n3. Reaction with metals \n\nMost organic chlorides, bromides and iodides react with certain metals to give compounds containing carbon-metal bonds. Such compounds are known as organo-metallic compounds. An important class of organo-metallic compounds discovered by Victor Grignard in 1900 is alkyl magnesium halide, $\\mathrm { R M g } \\mathrm { X } .$ referred as Grignard Reagents. These reagents are obtained by the reaction of haloalkanes with magnesium metal in dry ether. \n\n$\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C H _ { 2 } B r } + \\mathrm { M g \\xrightarrow { d r y \\ e t h e r } C H _ { 3 } C H _ { 2 } M g B r }$ Grignard reagent \n\nVictor Grignard had a strange start in academic life for a chemist - he took a maths degree. When he eventually switched to chemistry, it was not to the mathematical province of physical chemistry but to organic chemistry. while attempting to find an efficient catalyst for the process of methylation, he noted that Zn in diethyl ether had been used for this purpose and wondered whether the Mg/ether combination might be successful. Grignard reagents were first reported in 1900 and Grignard used this work for his doctoral thesis in 1901. In 1910, Grignard obtained a professorship at the University of Nancy and in 1912, he was awarded the Nobel prize for Chemistry which he shared with Paul Sabatier who had made advances in nickel catalysed hydrogenation. \n\n6.7.2 Reactions of Haloarenes \n\nIn the Grignard reagent, the carbon-magnesium bond is covalent but highly polar, with carbon pulling electrons from electropositive magnesium; the magnesium halogen bond is essentially ionic. \n\nGrignard reagents are highly reactive and react with any source of proton to give hydrocarbons. Even water, alcohols, amines are suficiently acidic to convert them to corresponding hydrocarbons. \n\nIt is therefore necessary to avoid even traces of moisture from a Grignard reagent. That is why reaction is carried out in dry ether. On the other hand, this could be considered as one of the methods for converting halides to hydrocarbons. \n\nWurtz reaction \n\nAlkyl halides react with sodium in dry ether to give hydrocarbons containing double the number of carbon atoms present in the halide. This reaction is known as wurtz reaction. \n\n2RX + 2Na →RR+2NaX \n\n1. Nucleophilic substitution \n\nAryl halides are extremely less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reactions due to the following reasons: \n\n(i) Resonance effect : In haloarenes, the electron pairs on halogen atom are in conjugation with $\\pi$ -electrons of the ring and the following resonating structures are possible. \n\nC—Cl bond acquires a partial double bond character due to resonance. As a result, the bond cleavage in haloarene is difficult than haloalkane and therefore, they are less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reaction. \n\n(ii) Difference in hybridisation of carbon atom in $C { - } X$ bond: In haloalkane, the carbon atom attached to halogen is $s p ^ { 3 }$ hybridised while in case of haloarene, the carbon atom attached to halogen is $s p ^ { 2 } .$ -hybridised. \n\nX sp²-hybrid carbon sp³-hybrid carbon R X \n\nThe $s p ^ { 2 }$ hybridised carbon with a greater s-character is more electronegative and can hold the electron pair of $\\mathrm { C - X }$ bond more tightly than $s p ^ { 3 } .$ -hybridised carbon in haloalkane with less $s { \\mathrm { . } }$ -chararcter. Thus, C—Cl bond length in haloalkane is $1 7 7 \\mathrm { p m }$ while in haloarene is $1 6 9 \\ \\mathrm { p m }$ . Since it is difficult to break a shorter bond than a longer bond, therefore, haloarenes are less reactive than haloalkanes towards nucleophilic substitution reaction.   \n(ii) Instability of phenyl cation: In case of haloarenes, the phenyl cation formed as a result of self-ionisation will not be stabilised by resonance and therefore, $\\mathsf { S } _ { \\mathrm { v } } \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ mechanism is ruled out.   \n(iv) Because of the possible repulsion, it is less likely for the electron rich nucleophile to approach electron rich arenes. \n\nReplacement by hydroxyl group \n\nChlorobenzene can be converted into phenol by heating in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at a temperature of 623K and a pressure of 300 atmospheres. \n\nThe presence of an electron withdrawing group $\\left( - \\mathrm { N O } _ { 2 } \\right)$ at ortho- and para-positions increases the reactivity of haloarenes. \n\n:C1: OH O₂NNO2 warm O₂NNO₂ H₂O NO2 NO2 \n\nThe effect is pronounced when $\\left( - \\mathrm { N O } _ { 2 } \\right)$ group is introduced at orthoand para- positions. However, no effect on reactivity of haloarenes is observed by the presence of electron withdrawing group at meta-position. Mechanism of the reaction is as depicted: \n\nCan you think why does $\\mathrm { N O } _ { 2 }$ group show its effect only at ortho- and para- positions and not at meta- position? \n\nAs shown, the presence of nitro group at ortho- and para-positions withdraws the electron density from the benzene ring and thus facilitates the attack of the nucleophile on haloarene. The carbanion thus formed is stabilised through resonance. The negative charge appeared at ortho- and para- positions with respect to the halogen substituent is stabilised by $- \\mathrm { N O } _ { 2 }$ group while in case of meta-nitrobenzene, none of the resonating structures bear thé negative charge on carbon atom bearing the $- \\mathrm { N O } _ { 2 }$ group. Therefore, the presence of nitro group at meta- position does not stabilise the negative charge and no effect on reactivity is observed by the presence of $- \\mathrm { N O } _ { 2 }$ group at meta-position. \n\n2. Electrophilic substitution reactions \n\nHaloarenes undergo the usual electrophilic reactions of the benzene ring such as halogenation, nitration, sulphonation and Friedel-Crafts reactions. Halogen atom besides being slightly deactivating is 0, $p { \\cdot }$ – directing; therefore, further substitution occurs at ortho- and parapositions with respect to the halogen atom. The o, $p$ -directing influence of halogen atom can be easily understood if we consider the resonating structures of halobenzene as shown: \n\nDue to resonance, the electron density increases more at ortho- and para-positions than at meta-positions. Further, the halogen atom because of its $- \\mathrm { I }$ effect has some tendency to withdraw electrons from the benzene ring. As a result, the ring gets somewhat deactivated as compared to benzene and hence the electrophilic substitution reactions in haloarenes occur slowly and require more drastic conditions as compared to those in benzene. \n\n(i) Halogenation (ii) Nitration \n\n1, 4-Dichlorobenzene (Major) \n\n(ii) Sulphonation \n\n4-Chlorobenzenesulfonic acid (Major) \n\n(iv) Friedel-Crafts reaction \n\nSolution \n\nAlthough chlorine is an electron withdrawing group, yet it is ortho-, para- directing in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Why? \n\nChlorine withdraws electrons through inductive effect and releases electrons through resonance. Through inductive effect, chlorine destabilises the intermediate carbocation formed during the electrophilic substitution. \n\n(attack at ortho-position) \n\n(attack at para-position) \n\nResonance effect stabilises the intermediate carbocation \n\nThrough resonance, halogen tends to stabilise the carbocation and the effect is more pronounced at ortho- and para- positions. The inductive effect is stronger than resonance and causes net electron withdrawal and thus causes net deactivation. The resonance effect tends to oppose the inductive effect for the attack at ortho- and parapositions and hence makes the deactivation less for ortho- and paraattack. Reactivity is thus controlled by the stronger inductive effect and orientation is controlled by resonance effect. \n\n3. Reaction with metals \n\nWurtz-Fittig reaction \n\nA mixture of an alkyl halide and aryl halide gives an alkylarene when treated with sodium in dry ether and is called Wurtz-Fittig reaction. \n\nFittig reaction \n\nAryl halides also give analogous compounds when treated with sodium in dry ether, in which two aryl groups are joined together. It is called Fittig reaction. \n\n6.7 which alkyl halide from the following pairs would you expect to react more rapidly by an $\\mathrm { \\mathsf { S } } _ { \\mathrm { N } } 2$ mechanism?

Many of these compounds are useful in industry and agriculture. Some polyhalogen compounds are described in this section. \n\n6.8.1 Dichloromethane (Methylene chloride) \n\nDichloromethane is widely used as a solvent as a paint remover, as a propellant in aerosols, and as a process solvent in the manufacture of drugs. It is also used as a metal cleaning and finishing solvent. Methylene chloride harms the human central nervous system. Exposure to lower levels of methylene chloride in air can lead to slightly impaired hearing and vision. Higher levels of methylene chloride in air cause dizziness, nausea, tingling and numbness in the fingers and toes. In humans, direct skin contact with methylene chloride causes intense burning and mild redness of the skin. Direct contact with the eyes can burn the cornea. \n\n6.8.2 Trichloro-methane(Chloroform)\n\nChemically, chloroform is employed as a solvent for fats, alkaloids, iodine and other substances. The major use of chloroform today is in the production of the freon refrigerant R-22. It was once used as a general anaesthetic in surgery but has been replaced by less toxic, safer anaesthetics, such as ether. As might be expected from its use as an anaesthetic, inhaling chloroform vapours depresses the central nervous system. Breathing about 9o0 parts of chloroform per million parts of air (900 parts per million) for a short time can cause dizziness, fatigue, and headache. Chronic chloroform exposure may cause damage to the liver (where chloroform is metabolised to phosgene) and to the kidneys, and some people develop sores when the skin is immersed in chloroform. Chloroform is slowly oxidised by air in the presence of light to an extremely poisonous gas, carbonyl chloride, also known as phosgene. It is therefore stored in closed dark coloured botles completely filled so that air is kept out. \n\nPhosgene \n\n6.8.3 Triiodomethane (Iodoform) \n\nIt was used earlier as an antiseptic but the antiseptic properties are due to the liberation of free iodine and not due to iodoform itself. Due to its objectionable smell, it has been replaced by other formulations containing iodine. \n\n6.8.4 Tetrachloromethane (Carbon tetrachloride) \n\nIt is produced in large quantities for use in the manufacture of refrigerants and propellants for aerosol cans. It is also used as feedstock in the synthesis of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and general solvent use. Until the mid 1960s, it was also widely used as a cleaning fluid, both in industry, as a degreasing agent, and in the home, as a spot remover and as fire extinguisher. There is some evidence that exposure to carbon tetrachloride causes liver cancer in humans. The most common effects are dizziness, light headedness, nausea and vomiting, which can cause permanent damage to nerve cells. In severe cases, these effects can lead rapidly to stupor, coma, unconsciousness or death. Exposure to $\\mathrm { C C l } _ { 4 }$ can make the heart beat irregularly or stop. The chemical may irritate the eyes on contact. When carbon tetrachloride is released into the air, it rises to the atmosphere and depletes the ozone layer. Depletion of the ozone layer is believed to increase human exposure to ultraviolet rays, leading to increased skin cancer, eye diseases and disorders, and possible disruption of the immune system. \n\n6.8.5 Freons \n\nThe chlorofluorocarbon compounds of methane and ethane are collectively known as freons. They are extremely stable, unreactive, non-toxic, noncorrosive and easily liquefiable gases. Freon 12 $\\mathrm { ( C C l _ { 2 } F _ { 2 } ) }$ is one of the most common freons in industrial use. It is manufactured from tetrachloromethane by Swarts reaction. These are usually produced for aerosol propellants, refrigeration and air conditioning purposes. By 1974, total freon production in the world was about 2 billion pounds annually. Most freon, even that used in refrigeration, eventually makes its way into the atmosphere where it diffuses unchanged into the stratosphere. In stratosphere, freon is able to initiate radical chain reactions that can upset the natural ozone balance. ▲ \n\n6.8.6 p,p'Dichlo-rodiphenyl-trichloro-ethane(DDT)\n\nDDT, the first chlorinated organic insecticides, was originally prepared in 1873, but it was not until 1939 that Paul Muller of Geigy Pharmaceuticals in Switzerland discovered the effectiveness of DDT as an insecticide. Paul Muller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1948 for this discovery. The use of DDT increased enormously on a worldwide basis after World War II, primarily because of its effectiveness against the mosquito that spreads malaria and lice that carry typhus. However, problems related to extensive use of DDT began to appear in the late 1940s. Many species of insects developed resistance to DDT, and it was also discovered to have a high toxicity towards fish. The chemical stability of DDT and its fat solubility compounded the problem. DDT is not metabolised very rapidly by animals; instead, it is deposited and stored in the fatty tissues. If ingestion continues at a steady rate, DDT builds up within the animal over time. The use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1973, although it is still in use in some other parts of the world. \n\nSummary \n\nAlkyl/ Aryl halides may be classified as mono, di, or polyhalogen (tri-, tetra-, etc.) compounds depending on whether they contain one, two or more halogen atoms in their structures. Since halogen atoms are more electronegative than carbon, the carbonhalogen bond of alkyl halide is polarised; the carbon atom bears a partial positive charge, and the halogen atom bears a partial negative charge. \n\nAlkyl halides are prepared by the free radical halogenation of alkanes, addition of halogen acids to alkenes, replacement of -OH group of alcohols with halogens using phosphorus halides, thionyl chloride or halogen acids. Aryl halides are prepared by electrophilic substitution to arenes. Fluorides and iodides are best prepared by halogen exchange method. \n\nThe boiling points of organohalogen compounds are comparatively higher than the corresponding hydrocarbons because of strong dipole-dipole and van der Waals forces of attraction. These are slightly soluble in water but completely soluble in organic solvents. \n\nThe polarity of carbon-halogen bond of alkyl halides is responsible for their nucleophilic substitution, elimination and their reaction with metal atoms to form organometalic compounds. Nucleophilic substitution reactions are categorised into Sy1 and Sy2 on the basis of their kinetic properties. Chirality has a profound role in understanding the reaction mechanisms of $\\mathsf { S } _ { \\mathrm { v } } 1$ and $\\mathrm { \\mathsf { S } } _ { \\mathrm { N } } 2$ reactions. $\\mathrm { \\mathsf { S } } _ { \\mathrm { N } } 2$ reactions of chiral alkyl halides are characterised by the inversion of configuration while $\\mathsf { S } _ { \\mathrm { v } } 1$ reactions are characterised by racemisation. \n\nA number of polyhalogen compounds e.g., dichloromethane, chloroform, iodoform, carbon tetrachloride, freon and DDT have many industrial applications. However, some of these compounds cannot be easily decomposed and even cause depletion of ozone layer and are proving environmental hazards. \n\nExercises \n\n6.1 Name the following halides according to IUPAC system and classify them as alkyl, allyl, benzyl (primary, secondary, tertiary), vinyl or aryl halides: \n\n(i) $\\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } C H C H ( C l ) C H _ { 3 } }$ (ii) (id:) $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C H _ { 2 } C H ( C H _ { 3 } ) C H ( C _ { 2 } H _ { 5 } ) C l }$ (ii) $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { C H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C ( C H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { ) } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { I }$ (iv) $\\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } C C H _ { 2 } C H ( B r ) C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } }$ (v) $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C H ( C H _ { 3 } ) C H ( B r ) C H _ { 3 } }$ (vi) $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { C } ( \\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { H } _ { 5 } ) _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { B r }$ (vii) $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C ( C l ) ( C _ { 2 } H _ { 5 } ) C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 3 } }$ (viii) (cid:) $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C H { = } C ( C l ) C H _ { 2 } C H ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } }$ (ix) (cid:) $\\scriptstyle \\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { C H } = \\mathrm { C H C } ( \\mathrm { B r } ) ( \\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 }$ (x) (cid:) $p \\mathrm { - C l C _ { 6 } H _ { 4 } C H _ { 2 } C H ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } }$ (xi) (cid:) $m { \\mathrm { - } } \\mathrm { C l C H _ { 2 } C _ { 6 } H _ { 4 } C H _ { 2 } C ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } }$ (xii) (cid:) $\\mathrm { \\Gamma _ { ^ { o - B r - C _ { 6 } H _ { 4 } C H ( C H _ { 3 } ) C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 3 } } } }$ \n\n6.2 Give the IUPAC names of the following compounds: \n\n(i) $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C H ( C l ) C H ( B r ) C H _ { 3 } }$ (i) $\\mathrm { C H F _ { 2 } C B r C l F }$ (i) $\\mathrm { C l C H _ { 2 } C { \\equiv } C C H _ { 2 } B r }$ (iv) $\\mathrm { \\ t C { C l _ { 3 } } { C C l } }$ (y) $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { C } ( p \\mathrm { - C l C } _ { 6 } \\mathrm { H } _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C H } ( \\mathrm { B r } ) \\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 }$ (vi) $\\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } C C H = C C l C _ { 6 } H _ { 4 } I } - p$ \n\n6.3 Write the structures of the following organic halogen compounds. \n\n(i) 2-Chloro-3-methylpentane (ii) $p$ -Bromochlorobenzene (iii) 1-Chloro-4-ethylcyclohexane (iv) 2-(2-Chlorophenyl)-1-iodooctane (v) 2-Bromobutane (vi) 4-tert-Butyl-3-iodoheptane (vii) 1-Bromo-4-sec-butyl-2-methylbenzene (vii) 1,4-Dibromobut-2-ene \n\n6.4 which one of the following has the highest dipole moment?

    "content": "Objectives \n\nAfter studying this Unit, you will be able to \n\nname alcohols, phenols and ethers according to the IUPAC system of nomenclature; discuss the reactions involved in the preparation of alcohols from alkenes, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids; discuss the reactions involved in the preparation of phenols from haloarenes, benzene sulphonic acids, diazonium salts and cumene; discuss the reactions for preparation of ethers from (i) alcohols and (ii) alkyl halides and sodium alkoxides/aryloxides; correlate physical properties of alcohols, phenols and ethers with their structures; discuss chemical reactions of the three classes of compounds on the basis of their functional groups. \n\nAlcohols, phenols and ethers are the basic compounds for the formation of detergents, antiseptics and fragrances, respectively. \n\nYou have learnt that substitution of one or more hydrogen atom(s) from a hydrocarbon by another atom or a group of atoms result in the formation of an entirely new compound having altogether different properties and applications. Alcohols and phenols are formed when a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon, aliphatic and aromatic respectively, is replaced by –OH group. These classes of compounds find wide applications in industry as well as in day-to-day life. For instance, have you ever noticed that ordinary spirit used for polishing wooden furniture is chiefly a compound containing hydroxyl group, ethanol. The sugar we eat, the cotton used for fabrics, the paper we use for writing, are all made up of compounds containing -OH groups. Just think of life without paper; no note-books, books, newspapers, currency notes, cheques, certificates, etc. The magazines carrying beautiful photographs and interesting stories would disappear from our life. It would have been really a different world. \n\nAn alcohol contains one or more hydroxyl (OH) group(s) directly attached to carbon atom(s), of an aliphatic system $\\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } O H ) }$ while a phenol contains –OH group(s) directly attached to carbon atom(s) of an aromatic system $\\mathrm { ( C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } O H ) }$ . \n\nThe substitution of a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon by an alkoxy or aryloxy group (R-O/Ar-O) yields another class of compounds known as 'ethers', for example, $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } O C H _ { 3 } }$ (dimethyl ether). You may also visualise ethers as compounds formed by substituting the hydrogen atom of hydroxyl group of an alcohol or phenol by an alkyi or aryl group. \n\nIn this unit, we shall discuss the chemistry of three classes of compounds, namely — alcohols, phenols and ethers. \n\nThe classification of compounds makes their study systematic and hence simpler. Therefore, let us first learn how are alcohols, phenols and ethers classified? \n\n7.1.1 Alcohols— Mono, Di, Tri or Polyhydric alcohols \n\nAlcohols and phenols may be classified as mono-, di-, tri- or polyhydric compounds depending on whether they contain one, two, three or many hydroxyl groups respectively in their structures as given below: \n\nCH2OH CH2OH CHOH C2H5OH CH2OH CH2OH Monohydric Dihydric Trihydric Monohydric alcohols may be further classified according to the hybridisation of the carbon atom to which the hydroxyl group is attached. \n\n(i) Compounds containing $\\mathrm { C } _ { s p ^ { 3 } } { - } \\mathrm { O H }$ bond: In this class of alcohols, the –OH group is attached to an $s p ^ { 3 }$ hybridised carbon atom of an alkyl group. They are further classified as follows: Primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols: In these three types of alcohols, the $- \\mathrm { O H }$ group is attached to primary, secondary and tertiary carbon atom, respectively as depicted below: \n\nPrimary (1°) \n\nTertiary (3°) \n\nAllylic alcohols: In these alcohols, the —OH group is attached to a $\\bar { s p } ^ { 3 }$ hybridised carbon adjacent to the carbon-carbon double bond, that is to an allylic carbon. For example \n\nPrimary \n\nBenzylic alcohols: In these alcohols, the —OH group is attached to a $s p ^ { 3 } .$ —hybridised carbon atom next to an aromatic ring. For example. \n\nAllylic and benzylic alcohols may be primary, secondary or tertiary. \n\n(ii) Compounds containing $\\mathrm { C } _ { s p ^ { 2 } } \\mathrm { - O H }$ bond: These alcohols contain —OH group bonded to a carbon-carbon double bond, i.e., to a vinylic carbon or to an aryl carbon. These alcohols are also known as vinylic alcohols. \n\nVinylic alcohol: $\\mathrm { C H _ { 2 } } = \\mathrm { C H } - \\mathrm { O H }$ (id:) \n\n7.1.2 Phenols— Mono, Di and trihydric phenols \n\n7.1.3 Ethers \n\nEthers are classified as simple or symmetrical, if the alkyl or aryl groups attached to the oxygen atom are the same, and mixed or unsymmetrical, if the two groups are different. Diethyl ether, $\\mathrm { C _ { 2 } H _ { 5 } O C _ { 2 } H _ { 5 } }$ , is a symmetrical ether whereas $\\mathrm { C _ { 2 } H _ { 5 } O C H _ { 3 } }$ and $\\mathrm { C _ { 2 } H _ { 5 } C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } }$ are unsymmetrical ethers. - \n\nIntext Questions \n\n7.1 Classify the following as primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols: \n\nCHg   \n(i) CH3− C − CH2OH (i) H2C = CH− CH2OH CH3 OH CH-CHg   \n(i) CH₃-CH2- CH2-OH (iv) CH₃ CH=CH-C-OH   \n(v) CH-CH-CH₃ (vi) CHz OH \n\n7.2 Identify allylic alcohols in the above examples. \n\n(a) Alcohols: The common name of an alcohol is derived from the common name of the alkyl group and adding the word alcohol to it. For example, $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } O H }$ is methyl alcohol. \n\nAccording to IUPAC system, the name of an alcohol is derived from the name of the alkane from which the alcohol is derived, by substituting 'e' of alkane with the suffix 'ol'. The position of substituents are indicated by numerals. For this, the longest carbon chain (parent chain) is numbered starting at the end nearest to the hydroxyl group. The positions of the $- \\mathrm { O H }$ group and other substituents are indicated by using the numbers of carbon atoms to which these are attached. For naming polyhydric alcohols, the 'e' of alkane is retained and the ending 'ol' is added. The number of -OH groups is indicated by adding the multiplicative prefix, di, tri, etc., before 'ol'. The positions of –OH groups are indicated by appropriate locants, e.g., HO $\\mathrm { \\mathrm { - C H _ { 2 } \\mathrm { - C H _ { 2 } \\mathrm { - O H } } } }$ is named as ethane-1, 2-diol. Table 7.1 gives common and IUPAC names of a few alcohols as examples. \n\nCyclic alcohols are named using the prefix cyclo and considering the $- \\mathrm { O H }$ group attached to ${ \\bf C } { - } 1$ . \n\n(b) Phenols: The simplest hydroxy derivative of benzene is phenol. It is its common name and also an accepted IUPAC name. As structure of phenol involves a benzene ring, in its substituted compounds the terms ortho (1,2- disubstituted), meta (1,3-disubstituted) and para (1,4-disubstituted) are often used in the common names. \n\nCHz OH \n\nCommon name IUPAC name \n\nPhenol Phenol \n\nCHz OH \n\no-Cresol 2-Methylphenol \n\nm-Cresol 3-Methylphenol \n\n(cid:) $p$ -Cresol 4-Methylphenol \n\nDihydroxy derivatives of benzene are known as 1, 2-, 1, 3- and 1, 4-benzenediol. \n\nCommon name IUPAC name \n\n(c) Ethers: Common names of ethers are derived from the names of alkyl/ aryl groups written as separate words in alphabetical order and adding the word 'ether at the end. For example, $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } O C _ { 2 } H _ { 5 } }$ is ethylmethyl ether. \n\nIf both the alkyl groups are the same, the prefix 'di' is added before the alkyl group. For example, $\\mathrm { C _ { 2 } H _ { 5 } O C _ { 2 } H _ { 5 } }$ is diethyl ether. \n\nAccording to IUPAC system of nomenclature, ethers are regarded as hydrocarbon derivatives in which a hydrogen atom is replaced by an —OR or –OAr group, where R and Ar represent alkyl and aryl groups, respectively. The larger (R) group is chosen as the parent hydrocarbon. The names of a few ethers are given as examples in Table 7.2. \n\nExample 7.1 Give IUPAC names of the following compounds: \n\n(i) CH3− CH – CH– CH– CH2OH 一 c1 CH_CHg \n\n(i) CH3 − CH − O− CH2CH3 CHg \n\nNO2 (iv) OC_H \\$ \n\nSolution \n\n(i) 4-Chloro-2,3-dimethylpentan-1-ol (i) 2-Ethoxypropane (ii) 2,6-Dimethylphenol (iv) 1-Ethoxy-2-nitrocyclohexane \n\nIntext Question \n\n7.3 Name the following compounds according to IUPAC system. \n\n(i) \n\nCH2OH CH3 - CH2 - CH - CH - CH-CH₃ CH2C1 CH3 \n\nCH2OH (i) CH3− CH − CH2 − CH − CH − CH3 CH₃ OH \n\n7.3 Structures of   \nfunctional   \nGroups \n\nIn alcohols, the oxygen of the -OH group is attached to carbon by a sigma $( \\sigma )$ bond formed by the overlap of a $s p ^ { 3 }$ hybridised orbital of carbon with a $s p ^ { 3 }$ hybridised orbital of oxygen. Fig. 7.1 depicts structural aspects of methanol, phenol and methoxymethane. \n\nThe bond angle $\\operatorname * { \\dot { \\rho } } _ { \\mathrm { ~ \\tiny ~ H ~ } } ^ { : 0 : }$ in alcohols is slightly less than the tetrahedral angle $[ 1 0 9 ^ { \\circ } \\ – 2 8 ^ { \\prime } ]$ . It is due to the repulsion between the unshared electron pairs of oxygen. In phenols, the –OH group is attached to $s p ^ { 2 }$ hybridised carbon of an aromatic ring. The carbon- oxygen bond length $[ 1 3 6 \\ \\mathrm { p m } ]$ in phenol is slightly less than that in methanol. This is due to (i) partial double bond character on account of the conjugation of unshared electron pair of oxygen with the aromatic ring (Section 7.4.4) and (ii) $s p ^ { \\widehat { 2 } }$ hybridised state of carbon to which oxygen is attached. \n\nIn ethers, the four electron pairs, i.e., the two bond pairs and two lone pairs of electrons on oxygen are arranged approximately in a tetrahedral arrangement. The bond angle is slightly greater than the tetrahedral angle due to the repulsive interaction between the two bulky (-R) groups. The C-O bond length $\\left( 1 4 1 ~ \\mathrm { p m } \\right)$ is almost the same as in alcohols. \n\n7.4.1 Preparation of Alcohols \n\nAlcohols are prepared by the following methods: \n\n1. From alkenes \n\n(i) By acid catalysed hydration: Alkenes react with water in the presence of acid as catalyst to form alcohols. In case of unsymmetrical alkenes, the addition reaction takes place in accordance with Markovnikov's rule. \n\nOH \n\nMechanism \n\nThe mechanism of the reaction involves the following three steps: \n\nStep 1: Protonation of alkene to form carbocation by electrophilic attack of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { O } ^ { + }$ . \n\nStep 2: Nucleophilic attack of water on carbocation. \n\nStep 3: Deprotonation to form an alcohol. \n\nHydroboration - oxidation was first reported by H.C. Brown in 1959. For his studies on boron containing organic compounds, Brown shared the 1979 Nobel prize in Chemistry with G. Wittig. \n\n(ii) By hydroboration-oxidation: Diborane $\\mathrm { ( B H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } }$ reacts with alkenes to give trialkyl boranes as addition product. This is oxidised to alcohol by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of aqueous sodium hydroxide. \n\nThe addition of borane to the double bond takes place in such a manner that the boron atom gets attached to the $s p ^ { 2 }$ carbon carrying greater number of hydrogen atoms. The alcohol so formed looks as if it has been formed by the addition of water to the alkene in a way opposite to the Markovnikov's rule. In this reaction, alcohol is obtained in excellent yield. \n\n2. From carbonyl compounds \n\n(i) By reduction of aldehydes and ketones: Aldehydes and ketones are reduced to the corresponding alcohols by addition of hydrogen in the presence of catalysts (catalytic hydrogenation). The usual catalyst is a finely divided metal such as platinum, palladium or nickel. It is also prepared by treating aldehydes and ketones with sodium borohydride $\\mathrm { ( N a B H _ { 4 } ) }$ or lithium aluminium hydride $\\mathrm { ( L i A l H _ { 4 } ) }$ 1. Aldehydes yield primary alcohols whereas ketones give secondary alcohols. \n\nThe numbers in front of the reagents along the arrow indicate that the second reagent is added only when the reaction with first is complete. \n\n(üi) By reduction of carboxylic acids and esters: Carboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols in excellent yields by lithium aluminium hydride, a strong reducing agent. \n\nHowever, $\\mathrm { L i A l H _ { 4 } }$ is an expensive reagent, and therefore, used for preparing special chemicals only. Commercially, acids are reduced to alcohols by converting them to the esters (Section 7.4.4), followed by their reduction using hydrogen in the presence of catalyst (catalytic hydrogenation). \n\n3. From Grignard reagents \n\nAlcohols are produced by the reaction of Grignard reagents (Unit 6, Class XIl) with aldehydes and ketones. \n\nThe first step of the reaction is the nucleophilic addition of Grignard reagent to the carbonyl group to form an adduct. Hydrolysis of the adduct yields an alcohol. \n\n….(i)) \n\nThe reaction of Grignard reagents with methanal produces a primary alcohol, with other aldehydes, secondary alcohols and with ketones, tertiary alcohols. \n\nThe overall reactions using different aldehydes and ketones are as follows: \n\nYou will notice that the reaction produces a primary alcohol with methanal, a secondary alcohol with other aldehydes and tertiary alcohol with ketones. \n\nGive the structures and IUPAC names of the products expected from the following reactions: \n\nExample 7.2 \n\n(a) Catalytic reduction of butanal. (b) Hydration of propene in the presence of dilute sulphuric acid. (c) Reaction of propanone with methylmagnesium bromide followed by hydrolysis. \\~H \n\n(a) CH-CH2−CH2−CH2-OH Butan-l-ol \n\n(b) CH-CH-CH OH \n\nSolution \n\n2-Methylpropan-2-ol \n\n7.4.2 Preparation of Phenols \n\nPhenol, also known as carbolic acid, was first isolated in the early nineteenth century from coal tar. Nowadays, phenol is commercially produced synthetically. In the laboratory, phenols are prepared from benzene derivatives by any of the following methods: \n\n1. From haloarenes \n\nChlorobenzene is fused with NaOH at 623K and 320 atmospheric pressure. Phenol is obtained by acidification of sodium phenoxide so produced (Unit 6, Class XII). \n\n2. From benzenesulphonic acid \n\nBenzene is sulphonated with oleum and benzene sulphonic acid so formed is converted to sodium phenoxide on heating with molten sodium hydroxide. Acidification of the sodium salt gives phenol. \n\n3. From diazonium salts \n\nA diazonium salt is formed by treating an aromatic primary amine with nitrous acid $\\mathrm { ( N a N O _ { 2 } + H C l ) }$ at 273-278 K. Diazonium salts are hydrolysed to phenols by warming with water or by treating with dilute acids (Unit 9, Class XI). \n\nMost of the worldwide production of phenol is from cumene. \n\n4. From cumene \n\nPhenol is manufactured from the hydrocarbon, cumene. Cumene (isopropylbenzene) is oxidised in the presence of air to cumene hydroperoxide. It is converted to phenol and acetone by treating it with dilute acid. Acetone, a by-product of this reaction, is also obtained in large quantities by this method. \n\nCH\\$ CH CHz-CH CH-C-O-O-H OH \\$f frac{}\\$ + CH2COCH3 Cumene Cumene hydroperoxide \n\n7.4 Show how are the following alcohols prepared by the reaction of a suitable Grignard reagent on methanal ? \n\nCH2OH (ii) \n\n7.5 Write structures of the products of the following reactions: \n\n(i) $\\mathrm { { C H } _ { 3 } - \\mathrm { { C H } = \\mathrm { { C H } _ { 2 } \\xrightarrow { \\mathrm { { H } _ { 2 } O / H ^ { + } } } } } }$ O CH2−C −OCH₃   \n(i) ö NaBH4   \n(i) CH₃—CH2—CH—CHO NaBH,d CH₃ \n\n7.4.3 Physical Properties \n\nAlcohols and phenols consist of two parts, an alkyl/aryl group and a hydroxyl group. The properties of alcohols and phenols are chiefly due to the hydroxyl group. The nature of alkyl and aryl groups simply modify these properties. \n\nBoiling Points \n\nThe boiling points of alcohols and phenols increase with increase in the number of carbon atoms (increase in van der Waals forces). In alcohols, the boiling points decrease with increase of branching in carbon chain (because of decrease in van der Waals forces with decrease in surface area). - \n\nThe -OH group in alcohols and phenols is involved in intermolecular hydrogen bonding as shown below: \n\nR H-OR cd:) R-O—H H R H H H-O…H-O…H-O \n\nIt is interesting to note that boiling points of alcohols and phenols are higher in comparison to other classes of compounds, namely hydrocarbons, ethers, haloalkanes and haloarenes of comparable molecular masses. For example, ethanol and propane have comparable molecular masses but their boiling points differ widely. The boiling point of methoxymethane is intermediate of the two boiling points. \n\nH H C H C CH3 \n\nCH3CH2 H \n\nH C CH3 \n\nEthanol Molecular mass/b.p. 46/351K \n\nMethoxymethane Molecular mass/b.p. 46/248K \n\nPropane Molecular mass/b.p. 44/231K \n\nThe high boiling points of alcohols are mainly due to the presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in them which is lacking in ethers and hydrocarbons. \n\nSolubility \n\nSolubility of alcohols and phenols in water is due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules as shown. The solubility decreases with increase in size of alkyl/aryl (hydrophobic) groups. Several of the lower molecular mass alcohols are miscible with water in all proportions. \n\nExample 7.3 Arrange the following sets of compounds in order of their increasing boiling points: (a) Pentan-1-ol, butan-1-ol, butan-2-ol, ethanol, propan-1-ol, methanol. (b) Pentan-1-ol, n-butane, pentanal, ethoxyethane. Solution (a) Methanol, ethanol, propan-1-o1, butan-2-ol, butan-1-ol, pentan-1-ol. (b) n-Butane, ethoxyethane, pentanal and pentan-1-ol. \n\n7.4.4 Chemical Reactions \n\nAlcohols are versatile compounds. They react both as nucleophiles and electrophiles. The bond between $\\mathrm { O - H }$ is broken when alcohols react as nucleophiles. \n\nAlcohols as nucleophiles $\\textcircled { 1 } \\stackrel { \\cdot } { \\mathrm { R } \\mathrm { - } \\stackrel { \\cdot } { \\cdot } } \\stackrel { \\cdot } { \\cdot } \\stackrel { \\cdot } { \\cdot } + \\stackrel { \\cdot } { \\zeta } - \\longrightarrow \\stackrel { \\cdot \\mathrm { H } \\mathrm { ~ - } \\stackrel { \\cdot } { \\mathrm { O } } \\mathrm { - } \\stackrel { \\cdot } { \\mathrm { C } } \\mathrm { - } } { \\cdot \\cdot } \\longrightarrow \\mathrm { R } \\mathrm { - } \\mathrm { O } \\mathrm { - } \\stackrel { \\cdot } { \\mathrm { C } } - \\mathrm { \\Lambda } \\stackrel { \\cdot } { \\mathrm { H } } ^ { + }$ \n\nProtonated alcohols as electrophiles \n\n(ii) The bond between ${ \\mathrm { C } } { \\mathrm { - } } { \\mathrm { O } }$ is broken when they react as electrophiles. Protonated alcohols react in this manner. \n\nBased on the cleavage of $\\mathrm { O - H }$ and ${ \\mathrm { C } } { \\mathrm { - } } { \\mathrm { O } }$ bonds, the reactions of alcohols and phenols may be divided into two groups: \n\n(a) Reactions involving cleavage of O-H bond \n\n1. Acidity of alcohols and phenols (i) Reaction with metals: Alcohols and phenols react with active metals such as sodium, potassium and aluminium to yield corresponding alkoxides/phenoxides and hydrogen. \n\nIn addition to this, phenols react with aqueous sodium hydroxide to form sodium phenoxides. \n\nOH ONa + NaOH + H2O Sodium phenoxide \n\nThe above reactions show that alcohols and phenols are acidic in nature. In fact, alcohols and phenols are Brönsted acids i.e., they can donate a proton to a stronger base (B:). \n\nB: + Y-Ö-R- →B-H + ∴-R Base Acid Conjugate Conjugate acid base \n\n(ii) Acidity of alcohols: The acidic character of alcohols is due to the polar nature of $\\mathrm { O - H }$ bond. An electron-releasing group (cid:) $\\mathrm { \\left( - C H _ { 3 } \\right. }$ , $\\mathrm { - C _ { 2 } H _ { 5 } ) }$ increases electron density on oxygen tending to   \n- decrease the polarity of $\\mathrm { O - H }$ bond. This decreases the acid strength. For this reason, the acid strength of alcohols decreases in the following order: \n\nAlcohols are, however, weaker acids than water. This can be illustrated by the reaction of water with an alkoxide. \n\n$\\begin{array} { r l r l r } { \\mathrm { R } { - } \\overleftarrow { \\dot { \\Omega } } _ { * } ^ { * } } & { { } { + } } & { \\mathrm { H } { - } \\overleftrightarrow { \\dot { \\Omega } } { - } \\mathrm { H } { \\longrightarrow } \\mathrm { R } { - } \\mathrm { O } { - } \\mathrm { H } } & { { } { + } } & { { \\vdots } \\overleftrightarrow { \\dot { \\Omega } } \\mathrm { H } } \\end{array}$ Base Acid Conjugate Conjugatt acid base \n\nThis reaction shows that water is a better proton donor (i.e., stronger acid) than alcohol. Also, in the above reaction, we note that an alkoxide ion is a better proton acceptor than hydroxide ion, which suggests that alkoxides are stronger bases (sodium ethoxide is a stronger base than sodium hydroxide). \n\nAlcohols act as Bronsted bases as well. It is due to the presence of unshared electron pairs on oxygen, which makes them proton acceptors. \n\n(ii) Acidity of phenols: The reactions of phenol with metals (e.g., sodium, aluminium) and sodium hydroxide indicate its acidic nature. The hydroxyl group, in phenol is directly attached to the $s p ^ { 2 }$ hybridised carbon of benzene ring which acts as an electron withdrawing group. Due to this, the charge distribution in phenol molecule, as depicted in its resonance structures, causes the oxygen of -OH group to be positive. \n\nThe reaction of phenol with aqueous sodium hydroxide indicates that phenols are stronger acids than alcohols and water. Let us examine how a compound in which hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic ring is more acidic than the one in which hydroxyl group is attached to an alkyl group. \n\nThe ionisation of an alcohol and a phenol takes place as follows: \n\nR-O-H=sR-O=+H+ OH + H+ \n\nDue to the higher electronegativity of $s p ^ { 2 }$ hybridised carbon of phenol to which $- \\mathrm { O H }$ is attached, electron density decreases on oxygen. This increases the polarity of $\\mathrm { O - H }$ bond and results in an increase in ionisation of phenols than that of alcohols. Now let us examine the stabilities of alkoxide and phenoxide ions. In alkoxide ion, the negative charge is localised on oxygen while in phenoxide ion, the charge is delocalised. The delocalisation of negative charge (structures I-V makes phenoxide ion more stable and favours the ionisation of phenol. Although there is also charge delocalisation in phenol, its resonance structures have charge separation due to which the phenol molecule is less stable than phenoxide ion. \n\nIn substituted phenols, the presence of electron withdrawing groups such as nitro group, enhances the acidic strength of phenol. This effect is more pronounced when such a group is present at ortho and para positions. It is due to the effective delocalisation of negative charge in phenoxide ion when substituent is at ortho or para position. On the other hand, electron releasing groups, such as alkyl groups, in general, do not favour the formation of phenoxide ion resulting in decrease in acid strength. Cresols, for example, are less acidic than phenol. \n\nThe greater the $ { \\mathrm { p } } K _ { a }$ value, the weaker the acid. \n\nFrom the above data, you will note that phenol is million times more acidic than ethanol. \n\nArrange the following compounds in increasing order of their acid strength: Example 7.4 Propan-1-ol, 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, 3-nitrophenol, 3,5-dinitrophenol, phenol, 4-methylphenol. \n\nPropan-1-ol, 4-methylphenol, phenol, 3-nitrophenol, 3,5-dinitrophenol, Solution 2,4, 6-trinitrophenol. \n\n2. Esterification \n\nAlcohols and phenols react with carboxylic acids, acid chlorides and acid anhydrides to form esters. \n\nAspirin possesses analgesic, antiinflammatory and antipyretic properties. \n\nThe reaction with carboxylic acid and acid anhydride is carried out in the presence of a small amount of concentrated sulphuric acid. The reaction is reversible, and therefore, water is removed as soon as it is formed. The reaction with acid chloride is carried out in the presence of a base (pyridine) so as to neutralise HCl which is formed during the reaction. It shifts the equilibrium to the right hand side. The introduction of acetyl $\\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } C O ) }$ group in alcohols or phenols is known as acetylation. Acetylation of salicylic acid produces aspirin. - \n\nCOOH COOH OH OCOCH3 + (CH3CO)2O H + CHgCOC Salicylic acid Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) \n\n(b) Reactions involving cleavage of carbon – oxygen (C-O) bond in alcohols \n\nThe reactions involving cleavage of $\\mathrm { C } { \\mathrm { - } } \\mathrm { O }$ bond take place only in alcohols. Phenols show this type of reaction only with zinc. \n\n1. Reaction with hydrogen halides: Alcohols react with hydrogen halides to form alkyl halides (Refer Unit 6, Class XII). \n\nThe difference in reactivity of three classes of alcohols with HCl distinguishes them from one another (Lucas test). Alcohols are soluble in Lucas reagent (conc. HCl and $\\mathrm { Z n C l _ { 2 } } )$ while their halides are immiscible and produce turbidity in solution. In case of tertiary alcohols, turbidity is produced immediately as they form the halides easily. Primary alcohols do not produce turbidity at room temperature. \n\n2. Reaction with phosphorus trihalides: Alcohols are converted to alkyl bromides by reaction with phosphorus tribromide (Refer Unit 6, Class XII). \n\n3. Dehydration: Alcohols undergo dehydration (removal of a molecule of water) to form alkenes on treating with a protic acid e.g., concentrated $\\mathrm { H _ { 2 } S O _ { 4 } }$ or $\\mathrm { H _ { 3 } P O _ { 4 } }$ , or catalysts such as anhydrous zinc chloride or alumina. \n\nEthanol undergoes dehydration by heating it with concentrated $\\mathrm { H _ { 2 } S O _ { 4 } }$ at $4 4 3 \\ \\mathrm { K }$ . \n\nSecondary and tertiary alcohols are dehydrated under milder conditions. For example \n\nThus, the relative ease of dehydration of alcohols follows the following order: \n\nThe mechanism of dehydration of ethanol involves the following steps: \n\nTertiary carbocations are more stable and   \ntherefore are easier to form than secondary and primary   \ncarbocations; tertiary alcohols are the easiest to dehydrate. \n\nMechanism \n\nStep 1: Formation of protonated alcohol. \n\nStep 2: Formation of carbocation: It is the slowest step and hence, the rate determining step of the reaction. \n\nStep 3: Formation of ethene by elimination of a proton. \n\nThe acid used in step 1 is released in step 3. To drive the equilibrium to the right, ethene is removed as it is formed. \n\n4. Oxidation: Oxidation of alcohols involves the formation of a carbonoxygen double bond with cleavage of an O-H and C-H bonds. \n\nSuch a cleavage and formation of bonds occur in oxidation reactions. These are also known as dehydrogenation reactions as these involve loss of dihydrogen from an alcohol molecule. Depending on the oxidising agent used, a primary alcohol is oxidised to an aldehyde which in turn is oxidised to a carboxylic acid. \n\nH OH RCH2OH Oxidation R-C=O →R-C=O Aldehyde Carboxylic acid \n\nStrong oxidising agents such as acidified potassium permanganate are used for getting carboxylic acids from alcohols directly. $\\mathrm { C r O } _ { 3 }$ in anhydrous medium is used as the oxidising agent for the isolation of aldehydes. \n\nA better reagent for oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes in good yield is pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), a complex of chromium trioxide with pyridine and HCl. \n\nSecondary alcohols are oxidised to ketones by chromic anhyride $\\mathrm { ( C r O _ { 3 } ) }$ . \n\nR-CH-R CrO3 R−C−R OH 0 Sec- alcohol Ketone \n\nTertiary alcohols do not undergo oxidation reaction. Under strong reaction conditions such as strong oxidising agents $\\mathrm { ( K M n O _ { 4 } ) }$ and elevated temperatures, cleavage of various C-C bonds takes place \n\nand a mixture of carboxylic acids containing lesser number of carbon atoms is formed. \n\nwhen the vapours of a primary or a secondary alcohol are passed over heated copper at 573 K, dehydrogenation takes place and an aldehyde or a ketone is formed while tertiary alcohols undergo dehydration. \n\nBiological oxidation of methanol and ethanol in the body produces the corresponding aldehyde followed by the acid. At times the alcoholics, by mistake, drink ethanol, mixed with methanol also called denatured alcohol. In the body, methanol is oxidised first to methanal and then to methanoic acid, which may cause blindness and death. A methanol poisoned patient is treated by giving intravenous infusions of diluted ethanol. The enzyme responsible for oxidation of aldehyde (HCHO) to acid is swamped allowing time for kidneys to excrete methanol. \n\n(c) Reactions of phenols \n\nFollowing reactions are shown by phenols only. \n\n1. Electrophilic aromatic substitution \n\nIn phenols, the reactions that take place on the aromatic ring are electrophilic substitution reactions (Unit 9, Class XI). The –OH group attached to the benzene ring activates it towards electrophilic substitution. Also, it directs the incoming group to ortho and para positions in the ring as these positions become electron rich due to the resonance effect caused by –OH group. The resonance structures are shown under acidity of phenols. \n\nCommon electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions taking place in phenol are as follows: \n\n2, 4, 6 - Trinitrophenol is a strong acid due to the presence of three electron withdrawing $- N O _ { 2 }$ groups which facilitate the release of hydrogen ion. \n\n(i) Nitration: With dilute nitric acid at low temperature (298 K), phenol yields a mixture of ortho and para nitrophenols. \n\nThe ortho and para isomers can be separated by steam distillation. $o$ -Nitrophenol is steam volatile due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding while $p$ -nitrophenol is less volatile due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding which causes the association of molecules. \n\no-Nitrophenol (Intramolecular H-bonding) \n\nwith concentrated nitric acid, phenol is converted to 2,4,6-trinitrophenol. The product is commonly known as picric acid. The yield of the reaction product is poor. \n\nNowadays picric acid is prepared by treating phenol first with concentrated sulphuric acid which converts it to phenol-2,4-disulphonic acid, and then with concentrated nitric acid to get 2,4,6-trinitrophenol. Can you write the equations of the reactions involved? \n\n(ii Halogenation: On treating phenol with bromine, different reaction products are formed under different experimental conditions. \n\n(a) when the reaction is carried out in solvents of low polarity such as $\\mathrm { C H C l } _ { 3 }$ or $\\mathrm { C S _ { 2 } }$ and at low temperature, monobromophenols are formed. \n\nThe usual halogenation of benzene takes place in the presence of a Lewis acid, such as $\\mathrm { F e B r _ { 3 } }$ (Unit 6, Class XII), which polarises the halogen molecule. In case of phenol, the polarisation of bromine molecule takes place even in the absence of Lewis acid. It is due to the highly activating effect of –OH group attached to the benzene ring. \n\n(b) when phenol is treated with bromine water, 2,4,6-tribromophenol is formed as white precipitate. \n\nExample 7.5 Write the structures of the major products expected from the following reactions: \n\n(a) Mononitration of 3-methylphenol (b) Dinitration of 3-methylphenol (c) Mononitration of phenyl methanoate. \n\nSolution The combined influence of $- \\mathrm { O H }$ and $\\mathrm { - C H _ { 3 } }$ groups determine the position of the incoming group. \n\n2. Kolbe's reaction \n\nPhenoxide ion generated by treating phenol with sodium hydroxide is even more reactive than phenol towards electrophilic aromatic substitution. Hence, it undergoes electrophilic substitution with carbon dioxide, a weak electrophile. Ortho hydroxybenzoic acid is formed as the main reaction product. \n\n3. Reimer-Tiemann reaction \n\nOn treating phenol with chloroform in the presence of sodium hydroxide, a –CHO group is introduced at ortho position of benzene ring. This reaction is known as Reimer - Tiemann reaction. \n\nThe intermediate substituted benzal chloride is hydrolysed in the presence of alkali to produce salicylaldehyde. \n\n4. Reaction of phenol with zinc dust \n\nPhenol is converted to benzene on heating with zinc dust. \n\n5.Oxidation \n\nOxidation of phenol with chromic acid produces a conjugated diketone known as benzoquinone. In the presence of air, phenols are slowly oxidised to dark coloured mixtures containing quinones. \n\nbenzoquinone \n\nIntexct Questions \n\n7.6 Give structures of the products you would expect when each of the following alcohol reacts with (a) HCl $\\mathrm { - } Z \\mathrm { n C l _ { 2 } }$ (b) HBr and (c) $\\mathrm { { S O C l } _ { 2 } }$ . \n\n(i) Butan-1-o1 (ii) 2-Methylbutan-2-0l \n\n7.7 Predict the major product of acid catalysed dehydration of \n\n(i) 1-methylcyclohexanol and (ii) butan-1-0l \n\n7.8 Ortho and para nitrophenols are more acidic than phenol. Draw the resonance structures of the corresponding phenoxide ions. \n\n7.9 Write the equations involved in the following reactions: \n\n(i) Reimer - Tiemann reaction (ii) Kolbe's reaction \n\nMethanol and ethanol are among the two commercially important alcohols. \n\n1. Methanol \n\nMethanol, $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } O H }$ , also known as 'wood spirit', was produced by destructive distillation of wood. Today, most of the methanol is produced by catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide at high pressure and temperature and in the presence of $\\mathrm { Z n O \\mathrm { ~ - ~ } C r _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } }$ catalyst. \n\nIngestion of ethanol acts on the central nervous system. In moderate amounts, it affects judgment and lowers inhibitions. Higher concentrations cause nausea and loss of consciousness. Euen at higher concentrations, it interferes with spontaneous respiration and can be fatal. \n\nMethanol is a colourless liquid and boils at $3 3 7 ~ \\mathrm { K }$ It is highly poisonous in nature. Ingestion of even small quantities of methanol can cause blindness and large quantities causes even death. Methanol is used as a solvent in paints, varnishes and chiefly for making formaldehyde. \n\n2. Ethanol \n\nEthanol, $\\mathrm { C _ { 2 } H _ { 5 } O H }$ , is obtained commercially by fermentation, the oldest method is from sugars. The sugar in molasses, sugarcane or fruits such as grapes is converted to glucose and fructose, (both of which have the formula $\\mathrm { C _ { 6 } H _ { 1 2 } O _ { 6 } ) }$ , in the presence of an enzyme, invertase. Glucose and fructose undergo fermentation in the presence of another enzyme, zymase, which is found in yeast. \n\nIn wine making, grapes are the source of sugars and yeast. As grapes ripen, the quantity of sugar increases and yeast grows on the outer skin. When grapes are crushed, sugar and the enzyme come in contact and fermentation starts. Fermentation takes place in anaerobic conditions i.e. in absence of air. Carbon dioxide is released during fermentation. \n\nThe action of zymase is inhibited once the percentage of alcohol formed exceeds 14 percent. If air gets into fermentation mixture, the oxygen of air oxidises ethanol to ethanoic acid which in turn destroys the taste of alcoholic drinks. \n\nEthanol is a colourless liquid with boiling point 351 K. It is used as a solvent in paint industry and in the preparation of a number of carbon compounds. The commercial alcohol is made unfit for drinking by mixing in it some copper sulphate (to give it a colour) and pyridine (a foul smelling liquid). It is known as denaturation of alcohol. \n\nNowadays, large quantities of ethanol are obtained by hydration of ethene (Section 7.4). \n\n7.6.1 Preparation of Ethers \n\nDiethyl ether has been used widely as an   \ninhalation anaesthetic. But due to its slow   \neff ect and an   \nunpleasant recovery period, it has been   \nreplaced, as an   \nanaesthetic, by other compounds. \n\nAlexander William Williamson (1824-1904) was born in London of Scottish parents. In 1849, he became Professor of Chemistry at University College, London. \n\n1. By dehydration of alcohols \n\nAlcohols undergo dehydration in the presence of protic acids $\\mathrm { ( H _ { 2 } S O _ { 4 } }$ , $\\mathrm { H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { P O } _ { 4 } )$ ). The formation of the reaction product, alkene or ether depends on the reaction conditions. For example, ethanol is dehydrated to ethene in the presence of sulphuric acid at $4 4 3 \\ \\mathrm { K }$ At $4 1 3 \\ \\mathrm { K }$ , ethoxyethane is the main product. \n\nThe formation of ether is a nucleophilic bimolecular reaction $\\textstyle { ( \\ S _ { \\mathrm { N } } 2 ) }$ (cid:) involving the attack of alcohol molecule on a protonated alcohol, as indicated below: \n\nAcidic dehydration of alcohols, to give an alkene is also associated with substitution reaction to give an ether. \n\nThe method is suitable for the preparation of ethers having primary alkyl groups only. The alkyl group should be unhindered and the temperature be kept low. Otherwise the reaction favours the formation of alkene. The reaction follows $\\mathrm { S } _ { \\mathrm { N } } 1$ pathway when the alcohol is secondary or tertiary about which you will learn in higher classes. However, the dehydration of secondary and tertiary alcohols to give corresponding ethers is unsuccessful as elimination competes over substitution and as a consequence, alkenes are easily formed. \n\nCan you explain why is bimolecular dehydration not appropriate for the preparation of ethyl methyl ether? \n\n2. williamson synthesis \n\nIt is an important laboratory method for the preparation of symmetrical and unsymmetrical ethers. In this method, an alkyl halide is allowed to react with sodium alkoxide. \n\nEthers containing substituted alkyl groups (secondary or tertiary) may also be prepared by this method. The reaction involves $\\mathrm { S } _ { \\mathrm { N } } 2$ attack of an alkoxide ion on primary alkyl halide. \n\nBetter results are obtained if the alkyl halide is primary. In case of secondary and tertiary alkyl halides, elimination competes over substitution. If a tertiary alkyl halide is used, an alkene is the only reaction product and no ether is formed. For example, the reaction of $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } O N a }$ with $\\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } C \\cdot }$ —Br gives exclusively 2-methylpropene. \n\n2-Methylpropene \n\nIt is because alkoxides are not only nucleophiles but strong bases as well. They react with alkyl halides leading to elimination reactions. \n\nExample 7.6 \n\nThe following is not an appropriate reaction for the preparation of t-butyl ethyl ether. \n\n(i) What would be the major product of this reaction ? \n\n(ii Write a suitable reaction for the preparation of t-butylethyl ether. \n\nSolution \n\n(i) The major product of the given reaction is 2-methylprop- 1-ene. It is because sodium ethoxide is a strong nucleophile as well as a strong base. Thus elimination reaction predominates over substitution. \n\nPhenols are also converted to ethers by this method. In this, phenol is used as the phenoxide moiety. \n\n7.6.2 Physical Properties \n\nThe C-O bonds in ethers are polar and thus, ethers have a net dipole moment. The weak polarity of ethers do not appreciably affect their boiling points which are comparable to those of the alkanes of comparable molecular masses but are much lower than the boiling points of alcohols as shown in the following cases: \n\nThe large difference in boiling points of alcohols and ethers is due to the presence of hydrogen bonding in alcohols. \n\nThe miscibility of ethers with water resembles those of alcohols of the same molecular mass. Both ethoxyethane and butan-l-ol are miscible to almost the same extent i.e., 7.5 and $9 \\mathrm { \\ : g \\ : }$ per $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m L } }$ water, respectively while pentane is essentially immiscible with water. Can you explain this observation ? This is due to the fact that just like alcohols, oxygen of ether can also form hydrogen bonds with water molecule as shown: \n\n7.6.3 Chemical Reactions \n\n1. Cleavage of C-0 bond in ethers \n\nEthers are the least reactive of the functional groups. The cleavage of C-O bond in ethers takes place under drastic conditions with excess of hydrogen halides. The reaction of dialkyl ether gives two alkyl halide molecules. \n\nAlkyl aryl ethers are cleaved at the alkyl-oxygen bond due to the more stable aryl-oxygen bond. The reaction yields phenol and alkyl halide. \n\nEthers with two different alkyl groups are also cleaved in the same manner. \n\nThe order of reactivity of hydrogen halides is as follows: $\\mathrm { H I } > \\mathrm { H B r } > \\mathrm { H C l } .$ The cleavage of ethers takes place with concentrated HI or HBr at high temperature. \n\nThe reaction of an ether with concentrated $\\mathrm { H I }$ starts with protonation of ether molecule. \n\nStep 1: \n\nThe reaction takes place with HBr or HI because these reagents are sufficiently acidic. \n\nStep 2: \n\nIodide is a good nucleophile. It attacks the least substituted carbon of the oxonium ion formed in step 1 and displaces an alcohol molecule by $\\mathrm { \\bf S } _ { \\mathrm { v } } 2$ mechanism. Thus, in the cleavage of mixed ethers with two different alkyl groups, the alcohol and alkyl iodide formed, depend on the nature of alkyl groups. when primary or secondary alkyl groups are present, it is the lower alkyl group that forms alkyl iodide $( \\mathrm { S } _ { \\mathrm { v } } 2$ reaction). \n\nWhen HI is in excess and the reaction is carried out at high temperature, ethanol reacts with another molecule of HI and is converted to ethyl iodide. \n\nStep 3: \n\nHowever, when one of the alkyl group is a tertiary group, the halide formed is a tertiary halide. \n\nIt is because in step 2 of the reaction, the departure of leaving group $\\mathrm { ( H O - C H _ { 3 } ) }$ creates a more stable carbocation $\\mathrm { [ ( C H _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } C ^ { + } ] }$ , and the reaction follows $\\mathbf { S } _ { \\mathrm { v } } \\mathbf { 1 }$ mechanism. \n\nIn case of anisole, methylphenyl oxonium ion, $\\mathrm { C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } - \\underset { H } { \\dot { \\mathrm { O } } } - C H _ { 3 } }$ is formed by protonation of ether. The bond between $\\mathrm { O - C H _ { 3 } }$ is weaker than the bond between $\\mathrm { O - C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } }$ because the carbon of phenyl group is $s p ^ { 2 }$ hybridised and there is a partial double bond character. \n\nTherefore the attack by I ion breaks $\\mathrm { O - C H _ { 3 } }$ bond to form $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } I }$ . Phenols do not react further to give halides because the ${ s p } ^ { 2 }$ hybridised carbon of phenol cannot undergo nucleophilic substitution reaction needed for conversion to the halide. \n\nGive the major products that are formed by heating each of the follwing Example 7.7 ethers with HI. \n\nCH{\\$ CH3 (i) CH3-CH2-CH-CH2-O-CH2-CH3 (i) CH-CH2-CH2-O-C−CH2CH₃ CHg \n\nCHg (i) CH3-CH2-CH-CH2OH + CH₃CH2I (i) CH₃CH2CH2OH + CH3CH2C−I Solution CH₃ CHg \n\n2. Electrophilic substitution \n\nThe alkoxy group (-OR) is ortho, para directing and activates the aromatic ring towards electrophilic substitution in the same way as in phenol. \n\n(i) Halogenation: Phenylalkyl ethers undergo usual halogenation in the benzene ring, e.g., anisole undergoes bromination with bromine in ethanoic acid even in the absence of iron (IIn) bromide catalyst. It is due to the activation of benzene ring by the methoxy group. Para isomer is obtained in $9 0 \\%$ yield. \n\n(üi) Friedel-Crafts reaction: Anisole undergoes Friedel-Crafts reaction, i.e., the alkyl and acyl groups are introduced at ortho and para positions by reaction with alkyl halide and acyl halide in the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride (a Lewis acid) as catalyst. \n\nOCH₃ OCH₃ OCH₃ CH₃ +CH,C1 Anhyd.

Ethers are classified on the basis of groups attached to the oxygen atom. - \n\nAlcohols may be prepared (l1) by hydration of alkenes (i) in presence of an acid and (i) by hydroboration-oxidation reaction (2) from carbonyl compounds by (i) catalytic reduction and (i) the action of Grignard reagents. Phenols may be prepared by (1) substitution of (i) halogen atom in haloarenes and (i) sulphonic acid group in aryl sulphonic acids, by -OH group (2) by hydrolysis of diazonium salts and (3) industrially from cumene. - \n\nAlcohols are higher boiling than other classes of compounds, namely hydrocarbons, ethers and haloalkanes of comparable molecular masses. The ability of alcohols, phenols and ethers to form intermolecular hydrogen bonding with water makes them soluble in it. \n\nAlcohols and phenols are acidic in nature. Electron withdrawing groups in phenol increase its acidic strength and electron releasing groups decrease it. \n\nAlcohols undergo nucleophilic substitution with hydrogen halides to yield alkyl halides. Dehydration of alcohols gives alkenes. On oxidation, primary alcohols yield aldehydes with mild oxidising agents and carboxylic acids with strong oxidising agents while secondary alcohols yield ketones. Tertiary alcohols are resistant to oxidation. \n\nThe presence of -OH group in phenols activates the aromatic ring towards electrophilic substitution and directs the incoming group to ortho and para positions due to resonance effect. Reimer-Tiemann reaction of phenol yields salicylaldehyde. In presence of sodium hydroxide, phenol generates phenoxide ion which is even more reactive than phenol. Thus, in alkaline medium, phenol undergoes Kolbe's reaction. \n\nEthers may be prepared by (i) dehydration of alcohols and (i williamson synthesis. The boiling points of ethers resemble those of alkanes while their solubility is comparable to those of alcohols having same molecular mass.
