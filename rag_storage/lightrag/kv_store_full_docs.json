It may be very hard to define mathematical beauty but that is just as true of beauty of any kind, we may not know quite what we mean by a beautifulpoet \n\n1.1 Introduction \n\nRecall that the notion of relations and functions, domain, co-domain and range have been introduced in Class XI along with different types of specific real valued functions and their graphs. The concept of the term‘relation’ in mathematics has been drawn from the meaning of relation in English language, according to which two objects or quantities are related if there is a recognisable connection or link between the two objects or quantities. Let A be the set of students of Class XII of a school and B be the set of students of Class XI of the same school. Then some of the examples of relations from A to B are \n\n(i) $\\{ ( a , b ) \\in \\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { B } \\} .$ a is brother of $b \\}$ ， Lejeune Dirichlet   \n(ii) $\\{ ( a , b ) \\in \\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { B } \\colon$ a is sister of $b \\}$ ， (1805-1859)   \n(i) $\\{ ( a , b ) \\in \\mathrm { A } \\times \\mathrm { B }$ age of $a$ is greater than age of $b \\}$ ，   \n(iv) $\\{ ( a , b ) \\in \\mathrm { A } \\times \\mathrm { B }$ : total marks obtained by $a$ in the final examination is less than the total marks obtained by $^ { b }$ in the final examination},   \n(v) $\\{ ( a , b ) \\in \\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { B } ; a$ lives in the same locality as $b \\}$ . However, abstracting from this, we define mathematically a relation R from A to B as an arbitrary subset of $\\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { B }$ \n\nIf $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ ,we say that $a$ is related to $^ { b }$ under the relation R and we write as $a$ R $^ { b }$ .In general, $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ ，we do not bother whether there is a recognisable connection or link between $a$ and $^ { b }$ .As seen in Class XI, functions are special kind of relations. \n\nIn this chapter, we will study different types of relations and functions, composition of functions, invertible functions and binary operations. \n\n1.2 Types of Relations \n\nIn this section, we would like to study different types of relations.We know that a relation in a set A is a subset of $\\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { A }$ .Thus, the empty set $\\phi$ and $\\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { A }$ are two extreme relations.For illustration, consider a relation R in the set A $\\backslash = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 \\}$ given by $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { R } } = \\{ ( a , b )$ $a - b = 1 0 \\}$ . This is the empty set, as no pair $( a , b )$ satisfies the condition $a - b = 1 0$ Similarly, $\\mathrm { R } ^ { \\prime } = \\{ ( a , b ) : | a - b | \\geq 0 \\}$ is the whole set $\\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { A } .$ ,as all pairs $( a , b )$ in $\\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { A }$ satisfy $| \\ a - b \\ | \\geq 0$ . These two extreme examples lead us to the following definitions. \n\nDefinition 1 A relation R in a set A is called empty relation, if no element of A is related to any element ofA, i.e., $\\operatorname { R } = \\Phi \\subset \\operatorname { A } \\times \\operatorname { A }$ \n\nDefinition 2 Arelation R in a set A is called universal relation, if each element of A is related to every element of A, i.e., ${ \\mathrm { R } } = { \\mathrm { A } } \\times { \\mathrm { A } }$ \n\nBoth the empty relation and the universal relation are some times called trivial relations. ■ \n\nExample 1 Let A be the set of all students of a boys school. Show that the relation R in A given by $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { R } } = \\{ ( a , b ) : a$ is sister of $b \\}$ is the empty relation and $\\ R ^ { \\prime } = \\{ ( a , b ) :$ the difference between heights of $a$ and $^ { b }$ is less than 3 meters} is the universal relation. \n\nSolution Since the school is boys school, no student of the school can be sister of any student of the school. Hence, ${ \\mathrm { R } } = \\phi$ ，showing that R is the empty relation. It is also obvious that the difference between heights of any two students of the school has to be less than 3 meters. This shows that $\\mathrm { R ^ { \\prime } } = \\mathbf { A } \\times \\mathbf { A }$ is the universal relation. \n\nRemark In Class XI, we have seen two ways of representing a relation, namely raster method and set builder method. However, a relation R in the set $\\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 \\}$ defined by R $= \\{ ( a , \\ b ) \\ : \\ b \\ = \\ a \\ + \\ 1 \\}$ is also expressed as $a$ R $^ { b }$ if and only if $b = a + 1$ by many authors. We may also use this notation, as and when convenient. \n\nIf $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ , we say that $a$ is related to $^ { b }$ and we denote it as $a \\mathrm { ~ R ~ } b$ \n\nOne of the most important relation, which plays a significant role in Mathematics, is an equivalence relation. To study equivalence relation, we first consider three types of relations, namely reflexive, symmetric and transitive. \n\nDefinition 3 A relation R in a set A is called \n\n(i) reflexive, if $( a , a ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ ,for every $a \\in \\mathbf { A }$   \n(ii) symmetric,if $( a _ { 1 } , a _ { 2 } ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ implies that $( a _ { 2 } , a _ { 1 } ) \\in \\mathbb { R } _ { \\mathrm { \\Omega } }$ for all $a _ { 1 } , a _ { 2 } \\in \\mathbf { A }$   \n(ii) transitive,if $( a _ { 1 } , a _ { 2 } ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ and $( a _ { 2 } , a _ { 3 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ implies that $( a _ { 1 } , a _ { 3 } ) \\in \\mathbb { R } _ { \\mathtt { f } }$ for all $a _ { 1 } , a _ { 2 } ,$ $a _ { _ 3 } \\in \\mathrm { A }$ \n\nDefinition 4 A relation R in a set A is said to be an equivalence relation if R is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. \n\nExample 2 Let Tbe the set of al triangles in a plane with R a relation in T given by $\\mathbf { R } = \\{ ( \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { T } _ { 2 } ) : \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ is congruent to $\\mathrm { T } _ { 2 } \\}$ . Show that R is an equivalence relation. \n\nSolution R is reflexive, since every triangle is congruent to itself. Further, $( \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { T } _ { 2 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R } \\Rightarrow \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ is congruent to $\\mathrm { T } _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow \\mathrm { T } _ { 2 }$ is congruent to $\\mathrm { T } _ { 1 } \\Rightarrow ( \\mathrm { T } _ { 2 } , \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R } .$ Hence, R is symmetric. Moreover, $( \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { T } _ { 2 } )$ ， $( \\Gamma _ { 2 } , \\mathrm { T } _ { 3 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R } \\Rightarrow \\Gamma _ { 1 }$ iscongruent to $\\mathrm { T } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { T } _ { 2 }$ is congruent to $\\mathrm { T } _ { 3 } \\Longrightarrow \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ is congruent to $\\mathrm { T } _ { 3 } \\Longrightarrow ( \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { T } _ { 3 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R } .$ Therefore,R is an equivalence relation. → \n\nExample 3 Let L be the set of all lines in a plane and R be the relation in L defined as $\\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( \\mathrm { L } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { L } _ { 2 } ) : \\mathrm { L } _ { 1 }$ is perpendicular to ${ \\mathrm { L } } _ { _ 2 } \\}$ . Show that $\\mathrm { R }$ is symmetric but neither reflexive nor transitive. \n\nSolution R is not reflexive,as aline $\\mathrm { L } _ { 1 }$ can not be perpendicular to itself,i.e., $( \\mathrm { L } _ { _ { 1 } } , \\mathrm { L } _ { _ { 1 } } )$ $\\not \\in \\mathrm { ~ R ~ }$ R is symmetric as $( \\mathrm { L } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { L } _ { 2 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ \n\n$\\Rightarrow$ $\\mathrm { L } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ is perpendicular to $\\mathrm { L } _ { 2 }$ $\\Rightarrow$ $\\mathrm { L } _ { 2 }$ is perpendicular to $\\mathrm { L } _ { 1 }$ $\\Rightarrow$ $( \\mathrm { L } _ { 2 } , \\mathrm { L } _ { 1 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R } .$ \n\nR is not transitive. Indeed, if $\\mathrm { L } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ is perpendicular to $\\mathrm { L } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { L } _ { 2 }$ is perpendicular to $\\mathrm { L } _ { 3 }$ ,then $\\mathrm { L } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ can never be perpendicular to $\\mathrm { L } _ { _ 3 }$ In fact, $\\mathrm { L } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ is parallel to $\\mathrm { L } _ { _ 3 } ,$ i.e., $( \\mathrm { L } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { L } _ { 2 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R } .$ $( \\mathrm { L } _ { 2 } , \\mathrm { L } _ { 3 } ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ but $( \\mathrm { L } _ { 1 } , \\mathrm { L } _ { 3 } ) \\not \\in \\mathrm { R } .$ \n\nExample 4 Show that the relation R in the set $\\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ given by ${ \\mathrm R } = \\{ ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 2 )$ $( 3 , 3 ) , ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 2 , 3 ) \\}$ is reflexive but neither symmetric nor transitive. \n\nSolution R is reflexive, since $( 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 2 )$ and (3,3) lie in R.Also, R is not symmetric, as $( 1 , 2 ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ but $( 2 , 1 ) \\notin \\mathrm { R }$ .Similarly, R is not transitive, as $( 1 , 2 ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ and $( 2 , 3 ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ but $( 1 , 3 ) \\not \\in { \\mathrm { R } }$ \n\nExample 5 Show that the relation R in the set $\\mathbf { Z }$ of integers given by \n\nis an equivalence relation. \n\nSolution R is reflexive, as 2 divides $( a - a )$ for all $a \\in \\mathbf { Z }$ .Further, if $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ then 2 divides $a - b$ .Therefore,2 divides $b - a$ Hence, $( b , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R } .$ ,which shows that R is symmetric. Similarly, if $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ and $( b , c ) \\in \\mathrm { R } .$ then $a - b$ and $b - c$ are divisible by 2. Now, $a - c = ( a - b ) + ( b - c )$ is even (Why?). So, $( a - c )$ is divisible by 2. This shows that R is transitive. Thus,R is an equivalence relation in $\\mathbf { Z }$ \n\nIn Example 5, note that all even integers are related to zero, as $( 0 , \\pm 2 )$ ， $( 0 , \\pm 4 )$ etc., lie in R and no odd integer is related to O, as $( 0 , \\pm 1 )$ ， $( 0 , \\pm 3 )$ etc., do not lie in R. Similarly, all odd integers are related to one and no even integer is related to one. Therefore, the set E of all even integers and the set O of all odd integers are subsets of Z satisfying following conditions: \n\n(i)All elements of E are related to each other and all elements of O are related to each other. (ii) No element of E is related to any element of O and vice-versa. (ii) E and O are disjoint and $\\mathbf { Z } = \\operatorname { E } \\cup \\mathrm { O }$ 一 \n\nThe subset E is called the equivalence class containing zero and is denoted by [0]. Similarly, O is the equivalence class containing 1 and is denoted by[1]. Note that $[ 0 ] \\neq [ 1 ] , [ 0 ] = [ 2 r ]$ and $[ 1 ] = [ 2 r + 1 ] , r \\in { \\bf Z }$ . Infact, what we have seen above is true for an arbitrary equivalence relation R in a set X. Given an arbitrary equivalence relation R in an arbitrary set X, R divides X into mutually disjoint subsets $\\mathbf { A } _ { _ i }$ called partitions or subdivisions of X satisfying: \n\n(i）all elements of $\\mathbf { A } _ { _ i }$ are related to each other, for all i. (ii) no element of $\\mathbf { A } _ { _ i }$ is related to any element of $\\mathrm { A } _ { j }$ ， $i \\neq j$ (i) $\\cup \\mathtt { A } _ { j } = \\mathtt { X }$ and $\\mathbf { A } _ { i } \\cap \\mathbf { A } _ { j } = \\boldsymbol \\Phi$ $i \\neq j$ \n\nThe subsets $\\mathbf { A } _ { _ i }$ are called equivalence classes. The interesting part of the situation is that we can go reverse also.For example, consider a subdivision of the set $\\mathbf { Z }$ given by three mutually disjoint subsets $\\mathbf { A } _ { 1 } , \\mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { A } _ { 3 }$ whose union is $\\mathbf { Z }$ with \n\n$\\mathbf { A } _ { 1 } = \\{ x \\in \\mathbf { Z } : x$ is a multiple of $3 \\} = \\{ . . . , - 6 , - 3 , 0 , 3 , 6 , . . . \\}$ $\\mathbf { A } _ { 2 } = \\{ x \\in \\mathbf { Z } : x - 1$ is a multiple of $3 \\} = \\{ . . . , - 5 , - 2 , 1 , 4 , 7 , . . . \\}$ $\\mathbf { A } _ { 3 } = \\{ x \\in \\mathbf { Z } : x - 2$ is a multiple of $3 \\} = \\{ . . . , - 4 , - 1 , 2 , 5 , 8 , . . . \\}$ \n\nDefine a relation R in $\\mathbf { Z }$ given by $\\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( a , b ) : 3$ divides $a - b \\}$ . Following the arguments similar to those used in Example 5, we can show that R is an equivalence relation. Also, $\\mathbf { A } _ { 1 }$ coincides with the set of allintegers in $\\mathbf { Z }$ which are related to zero, $\\mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ coincides with the set of all integers which are related to 1 and $\\mathbf { A } _ { 3 }$ coincides with the set of all integers in $\\mathbf { Z }$ which are related to 2. Thus, $\\mathbf { A } _ { 1 } = [ 0 ] , \\mathbf { A } _ { 2 } = [ 1 ]$ and ${ \\bf A } _ { 3 } = [ 2 ]$ In fact, A, = [3r], $\\mathbf { A } _ { 2 } ^ { } = [ 3 r ^ { + } 1 ]$ and ${ \\bf A } _ { 3 } = [ 3 r + 2 ] _ { \\ L }$ for all $r \\in \\mathbf { Z }$ \n\nExample 6 Let $\\mathrm { R }$ be the relation defined in the set $\\mathrm { A } = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 \\}$ by $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { R } } = \\{ ( a , b ) $ : both $a$ and $^ { b }$ are either odd or even}. Show that $\\mathrm { R }$ is an equivalence relation.Further, show that allthe elements of the subset $\\{ 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 \\}$ are related to each other and all the elements of the subset $\\{ 2 , 4 , 6 \\}$ are related to each other, but no element of the subset $\\{ 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 \\}$ is related to any element of the subset {2, 4, 6}. \n\nSolution Given any element $a$ in A, both $a$ and $a$ must be either odd or even, so that $( a , a ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ Further, $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R } \\Rightarrow$ both $a$ and $^ { b }$ must be either odd or even $\\Rightarrow ( b , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ Similarly, $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ and $( b , c ) \\in \\mathrm { R } \\Rightarrow$ all elements $a , b , c ,$ must be either even or odd simultaneously $\\Rightarrow ( a , c ) \\in \\operatorname { R } .$ Hence,R is an equivalence relation. Further, all the elements of $\\{ 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 \\}$ are related to each other, as all the elements of this subset are odd. Similarly,allthe elements of the subset $\\{ 2 , 4 , 6 \\}$ are related to each other, as all of them are even. Also, no element of the subset $\\{ 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 \\}$ can be related to any element of $\\{ 2 , 4 , 6 \\}$ , as elements of $\\{ 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 \\}$ are odd, while elements of {2, 4, 6} are even. \n\nEXERCISE 1.1 \n\n1．Determine whether each of the following relations are reflexive, symmetric and transitive: \n\n(i) Relation R in the set $\\mathrm { A } = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . , 1 3 , 1 4 \\}$ defined as $\\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( x , y ) : 3 x - y = 0 \\}$   \n(ii) Relation R in the set $\\mathbf { N }$ of natural numbers defined as $\\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( x , y ) : y = x + 5$ and $x < 4 \\}$   \n(ii) Relation R in the set $\\mathrm { A } = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \\}$ as $\\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( x , y ) : y { \\mathrm { ~ i s ~ d i v i s i b l e ~ b y ~ } } x \\}$   \n(iv) Relation R in the set $\\mathbf { Z }$ of all integers defined as $\\mathbb { R } = \\{ ( x , y ) : x - y$ is an integer}   \n(v) Relation R in the set A ofhuman beings in a town at a particular time given by (a) ${ \\mathrm { R } } = \\{ ( x , y ) : x$ and $y$ work at the same place} (b) $\\mathtt { R } = \\{ ( x , y ) : x$ and y live in the same locality} (c） ${ \\mathrm { R } } = \\{ ( x , y ) : x$ is exactly 7 cm taller than y} (d) $\\begin{array} { l } { { \\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( x , y ) : x \\mathrm { ~ i s ~ w i f e ~ o f ~ } y \\} } } \\\\ { { \\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( x , y ) : x \\mathrm { ~ i s ~ f a t h e r ~ o f ~ } y \\} } } \\end{array}$ (e) \n\n2.

As the concept of function is of paramount importance in mathematics and among other disciplines as well we would like to extend our study about function from where we finished earlier. In this section, we would like to study different types of functions. \n\nConsider the functions $f _ { 1 } , f _ { 2 } , f _ { 3 }$ and $f _ { 4 }$ given by the following diagrams. \n\nIn Fig 1.2, we observe that the images of distinct elements of $\\mathrm { X } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ under the function $f _ { 1 }$ are distinct, but the image of two distinct elements 1 and 2 of $\\mathrm { X } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ under $f _ { 2 }$ is same, namely $b$ .Further, there are some elements like $e$ and $f$ in $\\mathrm { X } _ { _ 2 }$ which are not images of any element of $\\mathrm { X } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ under $f _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 1 }$ , while all elements of $\\mathrm { X } _ { _ 3 }$ are images of some elements of $\\mathrm { X } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ under $f _ { 3 }$ . The above observations lead to the following definitions: \n\nDefinition 5 A function f: $\\Chi \\to \\Upsilon$ is defined to be one-one (or injective),if the images of distinct elements of $\\mathrm { X }$ under $f$ are distinct, i.e., for every $x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } \\in \\mathrm { X } , f ( x _ { 1 } ) = f ( x _ { 2 } )$ implies $x _ { 1 } = x _ { 2 }$ . Otherwise, $f$ is called many-one. \n\nThe function $f _ { 1 }$ and $f _ { 4 }$ in Fig 1.2 (i) and (iv)are one-one and the function $f _ { 2 }$ and $f _ { 3 }$ in Fig 1.2 (ii) and (iii) are many-one. \n\nDefinition 6 A function f $\\colon \\mathrm { X }  \\mathrm { Y }$ is said to be onto (or surjective), if every element of Y is the image of some element of $\\mathrm { X }$ under $f ,$ i.e., for every $y \\in \\mathrm { Y } ,$ there exists an element $x$ in $\\mathrm { X }$ such that $f ( x ) = y$ \n\nThe function $f _ { 3 }$ and $f _ { 4 }$ in Fig 1.2 (i), (iv) are onto and the function $f _ { 1 }$ in Fig 1.2 (i) is not onto as elements $e , f$ in $\\mathrm { X } _ { _ 2 }$ are not the image of any element in $\\mathrm { X } _ { _ 1 }$ under $f _ { 1 }$ \n\nRemark $f \\colon { \\mathrm { X } }  { \\mathrm { Y } }$ is onto if and only if Range of $\\mathrm { \\Delta } f = \\mathrm { Y } .$ \n\nDefinition 7 A function $f$ $\\mathrm { X } \\to \\mathrm { Y }$ is said to be one-one and onto (or bijective), if $f$ is both one-one and onto. \n\nThe function $f _ { 4 }$ in Fig 1.2 (iv) is one-one and onto. \n\nExample 7 Let A be the set of all 50 students of Class X in a school. Let f : $\\mathbf A \\to \\mathbf N$ be function defined by $f ( x ) =$ roll number of the student $x .$ Show that $f$ is one-one but not onto. \n\nSolution No two different students of the class can have same roll number. Therefore, $f$ must be one-one. We can assume without any loss of generality that roll numbers of students are from 1 to 50.This implies that 51 in Nis not roll number of any student of the class,so that 51 can not be image of any element of X under f. Hence, $f$ is not onto. \n\nExample 8 Show that the function $f \\colon \\mathbf { N }  \\mathbf { N } ,$ given by $f ( x ) = 2 x .$ , is one-one but not onto. \n\nSolution The function $f$ is one-one, for $\\mathbf { \\nabla } \\cdot f ( x _ { 1 } ) = f ( x _ { 2 } ) \\Rightarrow 2 x _ { 1 } = 2 x _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow x _ { 1 } = x _ { 2 } .$ Further, $f$ is not onto, as for $1 \\in \\mathbf { N } ,$ there does not exist any $x$ in $\\mathbf { N }$ such that $f ( x ) = 2 x = 1$ \n\nExample 9 Prove that the function f: $\\mathbf { R }  \\mathbf { R } .$ given by $\\boldsymbol { \\mathscr { f } } ( \\boldsymbol { x } ) = 2 \\boldsymbol { x } ,$ is one-one and onto. Solution $f$ is one-one, as $f ( x _ { 1 } ) = f ( x _ { 2 } ) \\Rightarrow 2 x _ { 1 } = 2 x _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow x _ { 1 } = x _ { 2 } .$ Also, given any real number $y$ in $\\mathrm { R }$ there xists $\\frac { y } { 2 }$ in R such hat $f ( \\frac { y } { 2 } ) = 2 . ( \\frac { y } { 2 } ) = y$ Hence $f$ is ot. \n\nExample 10 Show that the function f: $\\mathbf N \\to \\mathbf N$ given by $f ( 1 ) = f ( 2 ) = 1$ and $f ( x ) = x - 1$ for every $x > 2$ , is onto but not one-one. \n\nSolution $f$ is not one-one, as $f ( 1 ) = f ( 2 ) = 1 .$ But fis onto, as given any $y \\in \\mathbf { N } , y \\neq 1$ ， we can choose $x$ as $y + 1$ such that $f ( y + 1 ) = y + 1 - 1 = y .$ Also for $1 \\in \\mathbf { N } ,$ we have $f ( 1 ) = 1$ \n\nExample 11 Show that the function $f \\colon \\mathbf { R }  \\mathbf { R } .$ defined as $f ( x ) = x ^ { 2 }$ , is neither one-one nor onto. \n\nSolution Since $f ( - 1 ) = 1 = f ( 1 ) , f$ is not oneone.Also, the element-2 in the co-domain Ris not image of any element $x$ in the domain R (Why?). Therefore $f$ is not onto. \n\nExample $^ { 1 2 }$ Show that $f \\colon \\mathbf { N }  \\mathbf { N } .$ given by \n\nThe image of 1 and $^ { - 1 }$ under $f$ is 1. \n\nis both one-one and onto. \n\nSolution Suppose $f ( x _ { 1 } ) = f ( x _ { 2 } )$ .Note that if $x _ { 1 }$ is odd and $x _ { 2 }$ is even, then we will have $x _ { 1 } + 1 = x _ { 2 } - 1$ i.e., $x _ { 2 } - x _ { 1 } = 2$ which is impossible. Similarly, the possibility of $\\dot { x } _ { 1 }$ being even and $x _ { 2 }$ being odd can also be ruled out, using the similar argument. Therefore, both $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { _ 2 }$ must be either odd or even. Suppose both $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ are odd. Then $f ( x _ { 1 } ) = f ( x _ { 2 } ) \\Rightarrow x _ { 1 } + 1 = x _ { 2 } + 1 \\Rightarrow x _ { 1 } = x _ { 2 } .$ Similarly, if both $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { _ 2 }$ are even, then also $f ( x _ { _ { 1 } } ) = f ( x _ { _ { 2 } } ) \\Rightarrow x _ { _ { 1 } } - 1 = x _ { _ { 2 } } - 1 \\Rightarrow x _ { _ { 1 } } = x _ { _ { 2 } }$ . Thus, $f$ is one-one. Also,any odd number $2 r + 1$ in the co-domain $\\mathbf { N }$ is the image of $2 r + 2$ in the domain $\\mathbf { N }$ and any even number $2 r$ in the co-domain $\\mathbf { N }$ is the image of $2 r - 1$ in the domain $\\mathbf { N } .$ Thus, $f$ is onto. \n\nExample 13 Show that an onto function $f \\colon \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}  \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ is always one-one. \n\nSolution Suppose $f$ is not one-one. Then there exists two elements, say 1 and 2 in the domain whose image in the co-domain is same.Also, the image of 3 under $f$ can be only one element. Therefore, the range set can have at the most two elements of the co-domain {1,2,3},showing that $f$ is not onto,a contradiction. Hence,fmust be one-one. \n\nExample 14 Show that a one-one function $f \\colon \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}  \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ must be onto. \n\nSolution Since $f$ is one-one, three elements of $\\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ must be taken to 3 different elements of the co-domain $\\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ under $f .$ Hence, $f$ has to be onto. \n\nRemark The results mentioned in Examples 13 and 14 are also true for an arbitrary finite set X, i.e., a one-one function $f \\colon X \\to X$ is necessarily onto and an onto map $f \\colon X \\to X$ is necessarily one-one, for every finite set X. In contrast to this, Examples 8 and 1O show that for an infinite set, this may not be true.In fact, this is a characteristic difference between a finite and an infinite set. \n\nEXERCISE 1.2 \n\n1． Show that the function $f \\colon \\mathbf { R } _ { * } \\to \\mathbf { R } _ { * }$ defined by $f ( x ) = { \\frac { 1 } { x } }$ is one-one and onto, where $\\mathbf { R } _ { * }$ is the set of all non-zero real numbers.

Show that the Modulus Function $f \\colon \\mathbf { R }  \\mathbf { R } .$ given by $f ( x ) = | x | ,$ is neither oneone nor onto, where $\\mid x \\mid$ is $x ,$ if $x$ is positive or O and $| x | \\operatorname { i s } - x ,$ if $x$ is negative. \n\n5.

Justify your answer. \n\n11.Let $f \\colon \\mathbf { R }  \\mathbf { R } \\quad$ be defined as $f ( x ) = x ^ { 4 }$ .

Then the composition of $f$ and $g _ { \\mathrm { : } }$ , denoted by gof, is defined as the function gof : $\\mathbf A \\to \\mathbf C$ given by \n\nExample 15 Let $f \\colon \\{ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\}  \\{ 3 , 4 , 5 , 9 \\}$ and $g : \\{ 3 , 4 , 5 , 9 \\}  \\{ 7 , 1 1 , 1 5 \\}$ be functions defined as $f ( 2 ) = 3 , f ( 3 ) = 4 , f ( 4 ) = f ( 5 ) = 5$ and $g ( 3 ) = g ( 4 ) = 7$ and $g ( 5 ) = g ( 9 ) = 1 1$ Find gof. \n\nSolution We have $g o f ( 2 ) = \\ g ( f ( 2 ) ) = g ( 3 ) = 7 , g o f ( 3 ) = \\ g ( f ( 3 ) ) = g ( 4 ) = 7 ,$ $g o f ( 4 ) = \\ g ( f ( 4 ) ) = g ( 5 ) = 1 1$ and $g o f ( 5 ) = g ( 5 ) = 1 1 .$ ? \n\nExample 16 Find gof and fog, if $f$ ： $\\mathbf R \\to \\mathbf R$ and $g : \\mathbf { R }  \\mathbf { R }$ are given by $f ( x ) = \\cos x$ and $g ( x ) = 3 x ^ { 2 }$ . Show that $g o f \\neq f o g$ \n\nSolution We have $g o f ( x ) = \\ g \\left( f ( x ) \\right) = g ( \\cos \\ x ) = 3$ $( \\cos \\ x ) ^ { 2 } = 3 \\ \\cos ^ { 2 } \\ x .$ Similarly, $f o g ( x ) = f ( g ( x ) ) = f ( 3 x ^ { 2 } ) = \\csc$ S $( 3 x ^ { 2 } )$ . Note that $3 \\mathrm { c o s } ^ { 2 } x \\neq \\cos 3 x ^ { 2 } .$ for $x = 0$ Hence, $g o f \\neq f o g$ \n\nDefinition 9 A function $f \\colon X \\to \\mathrm { Y }$ is defined to be invertible, if there exists a function $g : \\mathrm { Y } \\to \\mathrm { X }$ such that $g o f { = } \\mathrm { I _ { x } } \\mathrm { a n d } f o g { = } \\mathrm { I _ { y } } .$ The function $g$ is called the inverse off and is denoted by $f ^ { - 1 }$ \n\nThus, if $f$ is invertible, then $f$ must be one-one and onto and conversely, if $f$ is one-one and onto,then fmust be invertible. This fact significantly helps for proving a function $f$ to be invertible by showing that $f$ is one-one and onto, specially when the actual inverse of $f$ is not to be determined. \n\nExample 17 Let $f \\colon \\mathbf { N }  \\mathrm { Y }$ be a function defined as $f ( x ) = 4 x + 3$ ,where, $\\mathrm { Y } = \\{ y \\in \\mathbf { N } \\colon y = 4 x + 3$ for some $x \\in \\mathbf { N } \\}$ . Show that $f$ is invertible. Find the inverse. \n\nSolution Consider an arbitrary element $y$ of Y. By the definition of Y, $y = 4 x + 3$ for some $x$ in the domain $\\mathbf { N }$ . This shows that $x = \\frac { \\left( y - 3 \\right) } { 4 }$ Define $g : \\mathrm { Y }  \\mathbf { N }$ by \n\n$f o g ( y ) = f ( g ( y ) ) = f { \\left( \\frac { ( y - 3 ) } { 4 } \\right) } = \\frac { 4 \\left( y - 3 \\right) } { 4 } + 3 = y - 3 + 3 = y .$ Thishosatet $g o f \\mathrm { = I _ { N } }$ and $f o g = \\mathrm { I _ { y } } .$ , which implies that $f$ is invertible and $g$ is the inverse off. \n\nMiscellaneous Examples \n\nExample 18 If $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ are equivalence relations in a set A, show that $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ is also an equivalence relation. \n\nSolution Since $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ are equivalence relations, $( a , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } { : }$ and $( a , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } \\ \\forall a \\in \\mathrm { A }$ This implies that $( a , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } , \\forall a .$ ，showing $\\mathsf { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathsf { R } _ { 2 }$ is reflexive. Further, $( a , b ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow ( a , b ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ and $( a , b ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow ( b , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ and $( b , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow$ $( b , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } { : }$ hence, $\\mathsf { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathsf { R } _ { 2 }$ is symmetric. Similarly, $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathbb { R } _ { 2 }$ and $( b , c ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow ( a , c ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ and $( a , c ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } \\Rightarrow ( a , c ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } .$ This shows that $\\mathsf { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathsf { R } _ { 2 }$ is transitive. Thus, $\\mathsf { R } _ { 1 } \\cap \\mathsf { R } _ { 2 }$ is an equivalence relation. \n\nExample 19 Let R be a relation on the set A of ordered pairs of positive integers defined by $( x , y ) \\mathrm { R } \\left( u , \\nu \\right)$ if and only if $_ { x \\nu } = y u$ . Show that R is an equivalence relation. \n\nSolution Clearly, $( x , y ) \\textrm { R } ( x , y ) , \\ \\forall \\ ( x , y ) \\in \\textrm { A } .$ since $x y = y x$ This shows that R is reflexive. Further, $( x , y ) \\textrm { R } ( u , \\nu ) \\Rightarrow x \\nu = y u \\Rightarrow u y = \\nu x$ and hence $( u , \\nu ) \\textrm { R } ( x , y )$ This shows that R is symmetric. Similarly, $( x , y ) \\textrm { R } ( u , \\nu )$ and $( u , \\nu ) \\operatorname { R } { ( a , b ) } \\Rightarrow x \\nu = y u$ and $u b = \\nu a \\Rightarrow x \\nu { \\frac { a } { u } } = y u { \\frac { a } { u } } \\Rightarrow x \\nu { \\frac { b } { \\nu } } = y u { \\frac { a } { u } } \\Rightarrow x b = y a$ and hence $( x , y ) \\textrm { R } ( a , b )$ . Thus,R is transitive. Thus, R is an equivalence relation. \n\nExample 20 Let $\\mathrm { X } = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\}$ .Let $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ be a relation in X given by $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } = \\{ ( x , y ) : x - y$ is divisible by 3} and $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 2 }$ be another relation on X given by $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } = \\{ ( x , y ) \\colon \\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 1 , 4 , 7 \\} \\}$ or $\\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 2 , 5 , 8 \\}$ or $\\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 3 , 6 , 9 \\} \\}$ . Show that ${ \\sf R } _ { 1 } = { \\sf R } _ { 2 }$ \n\nSolution Note that the characteristic of sets $\\{ 1 , 4 , 7 \\} , \\{ 2 , 5 , 8 \\}$ and $\\left\\{ 3 , \\ 6 , \\ 9 \\right\\}$ is that difference between any two elements of these sets is a multiple of 3. Therefore, $( x , y ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 1 } \\Rightarrow x - y$ is a multiple of $3 \\Rightarrow \\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 1 , 4 , 7 \\}$ or $\\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 2 , 5 , 8 \\}$ or $\\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 3 , 6 , 9 \\} \\Rightarrow ( x , y ) \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { 2 } .$ Hence, $\\mathsf { R } _ { 1 } \\subset \\mathsf { R } _ { 2 }$ Similarly, $\\{ x , y \\} \\in \\mathrm { R } _ { _ { 2 } } \\Rightarrow \\{ x , y \\}$ $\\textsf { C } \\{ 1 , 4 , 7 \\}$ or $\\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 2 , 5 , 8 \\}$ or $\\{ x , y \\} \\subset \\{ 3 , 6 , 9 \\} \\Rightarrow x - y$ is divisible by $3 \\Rightarrow \\{ x , y \\} \\in \\mathbb { R } _ { 1 }$ This shows that $\\mathsf { R } _ { 2 } \\subset \\mathsf { R } _ { 1 }$ Hence, ${ \\sf R } _ { 1 } = { \\sf R } _ { 2 }$ \n\nExample 21 Lety $f \\colon \\mathrm { X }  \\mathrm { Y }$ be a function. Define a relation R in X given by $\\mathrm { R } = \\{ ( a , b ) \\colon f ( a ) = f ( b ) \\} .$ Examine whether R is an equivalence relation or not. \n\nSolution For every $a \\in \\mathrm { X }$ $( a , a ) \\in \\mathbb { R } .$ since $f ( a ) = f ( a )$ ，showing that R is reflexive. Similarly, $( a , b ) \\in \\mathrm { R } \\Rightarrow f ( a ) = f ( b ) \\Rightarrow f ( b ) = f ( a ) \\Rightarrow ( b , a ) \\in \\mathrm { R }$ Therefore,R is symmetric.Further, $( a , b ) \\in \\mathbb { R }$ and $( b , c ) \\in \\mathrm { R } \\Rightarrow f ( a ) = f ( b )$ and $f ( b ) = f ( c ) \\Rightarrow f ( a )$ $\\mathbf { \\sigma } = f ( c ) \\Rightarrow ( a , c ) \\in \\mathbb { R } .$ ,which implies that R is transitive. Hence,R is an equivalence relation. 一 \n\nExample 22 Find the number of all one-one functions from set $A = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ to itself. \n\nSolution One-one function from $\\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ to itself is simply a permutation on three symbols 1, 2, 3. Therefore, total number of one-one maps from $\\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ to itself is same as total number of permutations on three symbols 1,2, 3 which is $3 ! = 6$ \n\nExample 23 Let $A = \\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\} .$ Then show that the number ofrelations containing $( 1 , 2 )$ and (2, 3) which are reflexive and transitive but not symmetric is three. \n\nSolution The smallest relation $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ containing $( 1 , 2 )$ and $( 2 , 3 )$ which is reflexive and transitive but not symmetric is $\\{ ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 2 ) , ( 3 , 3 ) , ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 2 , 3 ) , ( 1 , 3 ) \\}$ .Now, if we add the pair (2, 1) to $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 1 }$ to get $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ , then the relation $\\mathrm { R } _ { 2 }$ will be reflexive, transitive but not symmetric. Similarly, we can obtain $\\mathrm { R } _ { _ 3 }$ by adding $( 3 , 2 )$ to $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ to get the desired relation. However, we can not add two pairs (2,1), (3,2) or single pair $( 3 , 1 )$ to $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ at a time, as by doing so, we will be forced to add the remaining pair in order to maintain transitivity and in the process, the relation willbecome symmetric also which is not required. Thus, the total number of desired relations is three. \n\nExample 24 Show that the number ofequivalence relation in the set $\\{ 1 , 2 , 3 \\}$ containing (1,2) and (2, 1) is two. \n\nSolution The smallest equivalence relation $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ containing (1,2) and (2,1) is $\\{ ( 1 , 1 )$ (2, 2), (3,3), (1,2), (2,1)}. Now we are left with only 4 pairs namely (2,3), (3,2), (1, 3) and (3,1). If we add any one, say (2, 3) to $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ , then for symmetry we must add (3,2) also and now for transitivity we are forced to add $( 1 , 3 )$ and (3,1). Thus,the only equivalence relation bigger than $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ is the universal relation. This shows that the total number of equivalence relations containing $( 1 , 2 )$ and $( 2 , 1 )$ is two. \n\nExample 25 Consider the identity function $\\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { N } } : \\mathbf { N } \\to \\mathbf { N }$ defined as $\\operatorname { I } _ { \\mathbf { N } } \\left( x \\right) = x \\ \\forall x \\in \\mathbf { N } .$ Show that although $\\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { N } }$ is onto but $\\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { N } } + \\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { N } } : \\mathbf { N }  \\mathbf { N }$ defined as \n\nSolution Clearly $\\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathbf { N } }$ is onto.But $\\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { v } } + \\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { v } }$ is not onto, as we can find an element 3 in the co-domain $\\mathbf { N }$ such that there does not exist any $x$ in the domain $\\mathbf { N }$ with $( \\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { N } } + \\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { N } } ) \\left( x \\right) = 2 x = 3$ \n\nExample 26 Consider a function $f : [ 0 , \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } ]  \\mathbf { R }$ given by $f ( x ) = \\sin { x }$ and $g : [ 0 , \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } ]  \\mathbf { R }$ given by $g ( x ) = \\cos x .$ Show that $f$ and $_ g$ are n-one sut $f + g$ is not one-one. 一 \n\nSolution Since for any two distinct elements $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ in $\\left[ 0 , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right]$ si $x _ { 1 } \\neq \\sin x _ { 2 }$ and cos $x _ { 1 } \\neq \\cos x _ { 2 }$ both $f$ and $g$ must be one-one.But $\\left( f + g \\right) \\left( 0 \\right) = \\sin 0 + \\cos 0 = 1$ and $( f + g ) \\bigg ( \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\bigg ) = \\sin \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } + \\cos \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } = 1$ =1. Therefore,f+ g is not one-one.

This is the characteristic property of a finite set. This is not true for infinite set \n\nHistorical Note \n\nThe concept of function has evolved over a long period of time starting from R. Descartes (1596-1650), who used the word ‘function’ in his manuscript \"Geometrie” in 1637 to mean some positive integral power $x ^ { n }$ of a variable $x$ while studying geometrical curves like hyperbola, parabola and ellpse. James Gregory (i636-1675) in his work “ Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura” (1667) considered function as a quantity obtained from other quantities by successive use of algebraic operations or by any other operations. Later G. W. Leibnitz (1646-1716) in his manuscript “Methodus tangentium inversa, seu de functionibus” writen in 1673 used the word ‘function’to mean a quantity varying from point to point on a curve such as the coordinates of a point on the curve, the slope of the curve, the tangent and the normal to the curve at a point. However, in his manuscript “Historia’ (1714), Leibnitz used the word ‘function’ to mean quantities that depend on a variable. He was the first to use the phrase ‘function of $x '$ . John Bernoulli (1667-1748) used the notation $\\phi x$ for the first time in 1718 to indicate a function of $x$ But the general adoption of symbols like f, F, $\\boldsymbol { \\Phi }$ ， $\\boldsymbol { \\Psi }$ ...to represent functions was made by Leonhard Euler(1707-1783) in 1734 in the first part of his manuscript “Analysis Infinitorium\". Later on, Joeph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) published his manuscripts “Theorie des functions analytiques\" in 1793, where he discussed about analytic function and used the notion $f ( x ) , \\operatorname { F } ( x ) .$ $\\phi ( x )$ 'etc. for different function of $x$ . Subsequently, Lejeunne Dirichlet (1805-1859) gave the definition of function which was being used til the set theoretic definition of function presently used, was given after set theory was developed by Georg Cantor (1845-1918). The set theoretic definition of function known to us presently is simply an abstraction of the definition given by Dirichlet in a rigorous manner.",

    "content": "INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS \n\nMathematics, in general, is fundamentally the science of self-evident things. - FELIX KLEIN \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nIn Chapter 1, we have studied that the inverse of a function $f ,$ denoted by $f ^ { - 1 }$ ,exists iffis one-one and onto. There are many functions which are not one-one, onto or both and hence we can not talk of their inverses.In Class XI, we studied that trigonometric functions are not one-one and onto over their natural domains and ranges and hence their inverses do not exist.In this chapter, we shall study about the restrictions on domains and ranges of trigonometric functions which ensure the existence of their inverses and observe their behaviour through graphical representations. Besides, some elementary properties will also be discussed. \n\nThe inverse trigonometric functions play an important role in calculus for they serve to define many integrals. \n\nThe concepts ofinverse trigonometric functions is also used in science and engineering. \n\n2.2 Basic Concepts \n\nIn Class XI, we have studied trigonometric functions, which are defined as follows: sine function, i.e., sine : $\\mathbf { R }  [ - 1 , 1 ]$ cosine function, i.e., cos $: \\mathbf { R }  [ - 1 , 1 ]$ tangentfunction,i.e.ta $\\operatorname { 1 } : \\mathbf { R } - \\{ { \\boldsymbol { x } } : { \\boldsymbol { x } } = ( 2 n + 1 ) ~ { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , n \\in \\mathbf { Z } \\}  \\mathbf { R }$ cotangent function, i.e., $\\cot : \\mathbf { R } - \\{ \\textit { x } : x = n \\pi , n \\in \\mathbf { Z } \\}  \\mathbf { R }$ secant function, i.e., $\\sec : \\mathbf { R } - \\left\\{ x : x = ( 2 n + 1 ) \\ { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , n \\in \\mathbf { Z } \\right\\} \\to \\mathbf { R } - ( - 1 , 1 )$ cosecant function, i.e., cosec $: \\mathbf { R } - \\{ \\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } } : \\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } } = n \\pi , \\ n \\in \\mathbf { Z } \\}  \\mathbf { R } - ( - \\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { 1 } } , \\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { 1 } } )$ \n\nWe have also learnt in Chapter 1 that if f : $\\mathrm { X } { \\to } \\mathrm { Y }$ such that $f ( x ) = y$ is one-one and onto, then we can define a unique function $g : \\mathrm { Y } \\to \\mathrm { X }$ such that $g ( y ) = x ,$ where $x \\in \\mathrm { X }$ and $y = f ( x ) , y \\in \\mathrm { Y } .$ Here, the domain of $g =$ range offand the range of $g =$ domain of $f .$ The function $_ g$ is called the inverse of $f$ and is denoted by $f ^ { - 1 }$ .Further, $g$ is also one-one and onto and inverse of $_ g$ is $f .$ Thus, $\\begin{array} { r } { g ^ { - 1 } = ( f ^ { - 1 } ) ^ { - 1 } = f . } \\end{array}$ We also have \n\nand \n\nSince the domain of sine function is the set of all real numbers and range is the closed interval $[ - 1 , 1 ]$ . If we restrict its domain to $\\left[ { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right] .$ then it becomes one-one and onto with range $[ - 1 , 1 ]$ . Actually, sine function restricted to any of the intervals [-3ππ] 2'2][2'2 一π 元 , [ππ] 2 2 etc., is one-one and its range is $[ - 1 , \\ 1 ]$ .We can, therefore, define the inverse of sine function in each of these intervals.We denote the inverse of sine function by $\\sin ^ { - 1 }$ (arc sine function). Thus, $\\sin ^ { - 1 }$ is a function whose domain is $[ - 1 , 1 ]$ and range could be any of the intervals $\\left[ { \\frac { - 3 \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } \\right] , \\left[ { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right]$ or $\\left[ { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } } \\right]$ ， and so on. Corresponding to each such interval, we get a branch of the function $\\sin ^ { - 1 }$ . The branch with range $\\left[ { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right]$ is called the principal value branch, whereas other intervals as range give different branches of $\\mathrm { s i n ^ { - 1 } }$ . When we refer to the function $\\sin ^ { - 1 }$ , we take it as the function whose domain is $[ - 1 , 1 ]$ and range is $\\left[ { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right]$ We write $\\sin ^ { - 1 } : [ - 1 , 1 ]  [ \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } , \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } ]$ \n\nFrom the definition of the inverse functions,it follows that sin $( \\sin ^ { - 1 } x ) = x$ if $- \\ : 1 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and sin-1 $( \\sin x ) = x$ if $- { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } { \\leq x \\leq \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } }$ In other words, if $y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x ,$ then sin $y = x$ 2 \n\nRemarks \n\n(i) We know from Chapter 1, that if $y = f ( x )$ is an invertible function, then $x = f ^ { - 1 } \\left( y \\right)$ Thus, the graph of $\\mathrm { s i n ^ { - 1 } }$ function can be obtained from the graph of original function by interchanging $x$ and $y$ axes, i.e., if $( a , b )$ is a point on the graph of sine function, then $( b , a )$ becomes the corresponding point on the graph of inverse of sine function. Thus, the graph of the function $y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x$ can be obtained from the graph of $y = \\sin x$ by interchanging $x$ and $y$ axes. The graphs of $y = \\sin x$ and $y = \\bar { \\sin ^ { - 1 } x }$ are as given in Fig 2.1 (i), (i), (ii). The dark portion of the graph of $y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x$ represent the principal value branch. \n\n(ii) It can be shown that the graph of an inverse function can be obtained from the corresponding graph of original function as a mirror image (i.e., reflection) along the line $y = x$ .This can be visualised by looking the graphs of $y = \\sin x$ and $y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x$ as given in the same axes (Fig 2.1 (iii). \n\nLike sine function, the cosine function is a function whose domain is the set of äall real numbers and range is the set $[ - 1 , 1 ]$ . If we restrict the domain of cosine function to $[ 0 , \\pi ]$ ,then it becomes one-one and onto with range $[ - 1 , 1 ]$ . Actually, cosine function restricted to any of the intervals $[ - \\pi , 0 ]$ ， $[ 0 , \\pi ] , [ \\pi , 2 \\pi ]$ etc., is bijective with range as $[ - 1 , \\ 1 ]$ . We can, therefore,define the inverse of cosine function in each of these intervals. We denote the inverse of the cosine function by $\\cos ^ { - 1 }$ (arc cosine function). \n\nThus, $\\cos ^ { - 1 }$ is a function whose domain is $[ - 1 , \\ 1 ]$ and range could be any of the intervals $[ - \\pi , \\ 0 ] , \\ [ 0 , \\ \\pi ] , \\ [ \\pi , \\ 2 \\pi ]$ etc. Corresponding to each such interval, we get a branch of the function $\\cos ^ { - 1 }$ . The branch with range $[ 0 , \\pi ]$ is called the principal value branch of the function $\\cos ^ { - 1 }$ . We write \n\nThe graph of the function given by $y = \\cos ^ { - 1 } x$ can be drawn in the same way as discussed about the graph of $y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x .$ The graphs of $y = \\cos x $ and $y = \\cos ^ { - 1 } x$ are given in Fig 2.2 (i) and (i). \n\n5元 元 X'← 2 π 2π Y rep y= cos x Fig 2.2 (i) \n\nLet us now discuss cosec $^ { - 1 } x$ and $\\sec ^ { - 1 } x$ as follows: \n\nSince, cosec $x = { \\frac { 1 } { \\sin x } }$ the domain of the cosec function is the set $\\{ x : x \\in \\mathbf { R }$ and $x \\neq n \\pi$ $n \\in { \\bf Z } \\}$ and the range is the set $\\{ y : y \\in \\mathbf { R }$ $y \\geq 1$ or $y \\leq - 1 \\}$ i.e., the set $\\mathbf { R } - ( - 1 , 1 )$ . It means that $y = \\csc x$ assumes all real values except $- 1 < y < 1$ and is not defined for integral multiple of $\\pi$ .If we restrict the domain of cosec function to $\\left[ - \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } , \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\right] - \\{ 0 \\}$ theo $\\mathbf { R } - ( - 1 , 1 )$ Actually, Cosec function restricted to any of the intervals $\\left[ \\frac { - 3 \\pi } { 2 } , \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } \\right] - \\{ - \\pi \\} , \\left[ \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } , \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\right] - \\{ 0 \\} ,$ $\\left[ { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } } \\right] - \\{ \\pi \\}$ i $\\mathbf { R } - ( - 1 , 1 )$ \n\n$\\mathbf { R } - ( - 1 , 1 )$ be any of the intervals $\\left[ { \\frac { - 3 \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } \\right] - \\left\\{ - \\pi \\right\\} , \\left[ { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right] - \\left\\{ 0 \\right\\} , \\left[ { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } } \\right] - \\left\\{ \\pi \\right\\}$ etc. The function corresponding to the range ${ \\bigg [ } { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } { \\bigg ] } - \\{ 0 \\}$ of cosec-1. We thus have principal branch as \n\nThe graphs of $y = \\csc x$ and $y = \\cos \\operatorname { e c } ^ { - 1 } x$ are given in Fig 2.3 (i), (ii). \n\nAlso, since sec $x = { \\frac { 1 } { \\cos x } }$ , the domain of $y = \\sec x$ is the set $\\mathbf { R } - \\left\\{ x : x = \\left( 2 n + 1 \\right) \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } . \\right.$ $n \\in \\mathbf { Z } \\}$ and range is the set $\\mathbf { R } - ( - 1 , 1 )$ . It means that sec (secant function) assumes all real values except $- 1 < y < 1$ and is not defined for odd multiples of $\\frac { \\pi } { 2 }$ If we restrict the domain of secant functionto $[ 0 , \\pi ] - \\{ { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\}$ ,then itis one-oneandontowith its range as the set $\\mathbf { R } - ( - 1 , 1 )$ . Actually, secant function restricted to any of the intervals $[ - \\pi , 0 ] - \\{ \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } \\} , [ 0 , \\pi ] - \\left\\{ \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\right\\} , [ \\pi , 2 \\pi ] - \\{ \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } \\}$ etc., is bijective and its range is $\\mathbf { R } - \\{ - 1 , 1 \\}$ .Thus $\\sec ^ { - 1 }$ can be defined as a function whose domain is $\\mathbf { R } { - } \\left( { - } 1 , 1 \\right)$ and range could be any of he intervals $[ - \\pi , 0 ] - \\{ \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } \\} , [ 0 , \\pi ] - \\{ \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\} , [ \\pi , 2 \\pi ] - \\{ \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } \\}$ etc. Corresponding to each of these intervals, we get different branches of the function sec-1. The branch with range $[ 0 , \\pi ] - \\{ \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\}$ is called the principal value branch of the function $\\sec ^ { - 1 }$ . We thus have \n\nThe graphs of the functions $y = \\sec x$ and $y = \\sec ^ { - 1 } x$ are given in Fig 2.4 (i), (i). \n\nFinally, we now discuss tan-1 and cot-1 \n\nWe know that the domain of the tan function (tangent function) is the set $\\{ x : x \\in \\mathbf { R }$ and $x \\neq ( 2 n + 1 ) \\ { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , n \\in \\mathbf { Z } \\}$ andterangisReansttcin is notdefinedforodduliples f ${ \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } .$ If we restrict the domain of tangent function to $\\left( { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right)$ , then it is one-one and onto with its range as $\\mathbf { R }$ Actually, tangent function restricted to any of the intervals $\\left( { \\frac { - 3 \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } \\right) , \\left( { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right) , \\left( { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } } \\right)$ etc., is bijective and its range is R. Thus tan-1 can be defined as a function whose domain is $\\mathbf { R }$ and range could be any of the intervals $\\left( { \\frac { - 3 \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } \\right) , \\left( { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right) , \\left( { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 2 } } \\right)$ and so on. These intervals give diferent branches of the function tan-1.The branch with range $\\left( \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } , \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } \\right)$ is called the principal value branch of the function tan-1. \n\nWe thus have \n\nThe graphs of the function $y = \\tan x $ and $y = \\tan ^ { - 1 } x$ are given in Fig 2.5 (i), (ii). \n\nWe know that domain of the cot function (cotangent function） is the set $\\{ x : x \\in \\mathbf { R }$ and $x \\neq n \\pi , n \\in \\mathbf { Z } \\}$ and range is R. It means that cotangent function is not defined for integral multiples of $\\pi .$ . If we restrict the domain of cotangent function to $( 0 , \\pi )$ , then it is bijective with and its range as R.In fact, cotangent function restricted to any of the intervals $( - \\pi , 0 ) , ( 0 , \\pi ) , ( \\pi , 2 \\pi )$ etc., is bijective and its range is R. Thus cot-l can be defined as a function whose domain is the R and range as any of the intervals $( - \\pi , 0 ) , ( 0 , \\pi ) , ( \\pi , 2 \\pi )$ etc. These intervals give different branches of the function cot-1. The function with range $( 0 , \\pi )$ is called the principal value branch of the function cot-1. We thus have \n\nThe graphs of $y = \\cot x $ and $y = \\cot ^ { - 1 } x$ are given in Fig 2.6 (i), (ii). \n\nThe following table gives the inverse trigonometric function (principal value branches) along with their domains and ranges. \n\nNote \n\n1. $\\sin ^ { - 1 } x$ should not be confused with $( \\sin x ) ^ { - 1 }$ . In fact $( \\sin x ) ^ { - 1 } = { \\frac { 1 } { \\sin x } }$ and similarly for other trigonometric functions.   \n2. Whenever no branch of an inverse trigonometric functions is mentioned, we mean the principal value branch of that function.   \n3. The value of an inverse trigonometric functions which lies in the range of principal branch is called the principal value of that inverse trigonometric functions. \n\nWe now consider some examples: \n\nWe know that the range of the principal value branch of $\\sin ^ { - 1 }$ is $\\left( { \\frac { - \\pi } { 2 } } , { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\right)$ and $\\sin \\left( { \\frac { \\pi } { 4 } } \\right) = { \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } }$ . Therefore, principal value of $\\sin ^ { - 1 } \\left( { \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } } \\right) { \\mathrm { i s ~ } } { \\frac { \\pi } { 4 } }$ Example 2 Find the principal value of cot-l $\\left( { \\frac { - 1 } { \\sqrt { 3 } } } \\right)$ R Solution Let cot- $\\left( { \\frac { - 1 } { \\sqrt { 3 } } } \\right) = y$ =y. Then, \n\nWe know that the range of principal value branch of cot-1 is $( 0 , \\pi )$ and cot $\\left( { \\frac { 2 \\pi } { 3 } } \\right) = { \\frac { - 1 } { \\sqrt { 3 } } }$ Hence, principal value of cot-1 $\\left( { \\frac { - 1 } { \\sqrt { 3 } } } \\right)$ is $\\frac { 2 \\pi } { 3 }$ \n\nEXERCISE 2.1 \n\nFind the principal values of the following: \n\n1.sm([） 2( 3.cosec-1 (2)   \n4. tan-1 (-√3) 6. tan-1 (-1) \n\n8.cot1 (3) $\\cdot \\cos ^ { - 1 } \\left( - { \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } } \\right)$ \n\n10. $\\mathsf { c o s e c } ^ { - 1 } \\ ( \\mathsf { \\Sigma } _ { - } \\sqrt { 2 } \\ )$ \n\nFind the values of the following: \n\n$\\tan ^ { - 1 } ( 1 ) + \\cos ^ { - 1 } - { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } + \\sin ^ { - 1 } - { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } }$ 1 1   \n11. 12. cos-1 2 +2 sin-1 2 \n\n13.If $\\sin ^ { - 1 } x = y ;$ then \n\n(A) $0 \\leq y \\leq \\pi$ (B) ≤y≤ (C) $0 < y < \\pi$ (D) 2 元 <y< \n\n14. $\\tan ^ { - 1 } { \\sqrt { 3 } } - \\sec ^ { - 1 } \\left( - 2 \\right)$ is equal to \n\n(A）π (B) $- { \\frac { \\pi } { 3 } }$ 元 (D） 2 \n\n2.3 Properties of Inverse Trigonometric Functions \n\nIn this section, we shall prove some important properties of inverse trigonometric functions. It may be mentioned here that these results are valid within the principal value branches of the corresponding inverse trigonometric functions and wherever they are defined. Some results may not be valid for all values of the domains of inverse trigonometric functions.In fact, they will be valid only for some values of $x$ for which inverse trigonometric functions are defined.We will not go into the details of these values of $x$ in the domain as this discussion goes beyond the scope of this textbook. \n\nLet us recall that if $y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x ,$ then $x = \\sin y$ and if $x = \\sin y$ ,then $y = \\sin ^ { - 1 } x$ This is equivalent to Y \n\nFor suitable values of domain similar results follow for remaining trigonometric functions. \n\nWe now consider some examples. \n\nExample 3 Show that \n\nSolution \n\n(i) Let $x = \\sin \\theta$ Then $\\sin ^ { - 1 } x = 0$ .We have \n\n(i)Take $x = \\cos \\theta$ , then proceeding as above, we get, $\\sin ^ { - 1 } \\left( 2 x { \\sqrt { 1 - x ^ { 2 } } } \\right) = 2 \\cos ^ { - 1 } x$ \n\nExample 4 Express tan-1 1-snx ， $\\frac { \\cdot 3 \\pi } { 2 } < x < \\frac { \\pi } { 2 }$ in the simplest form. \n\nSolution We write \n\n$\\cot ^ { - 1 } \\left( \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { x ^ { 2 } - 1 } } \\right) , ~ x > 1$ \n\nSolution Let $x = \\sec \\theta$ then ${ \\sqrt { x ^ { 2 } - 1 } } = { \\sqrt { \\sec ^ { 2 } \\theta - 1 } } = \\tan \\theta$ \n\nTherefore, cot-1. $\\cot ^ { - 1 } \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { x ^ { 2 } - 1 } } = \\cot ^ { - 1 } \\left( \\cot \\theta \\right) = \\Theta = \\sec ^ { - 1 } x ,$ which is the simplest form. \n\nEXERCISE 2.2 \n\nProve the following: \n\nWrite the following functions in the simplest form: \n\n3. $\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\tan ^ { - 1 } \\displaystyle \\frac { \\sqrt { 1 + x ^ { 2 } } - 1 } { x } , x \\neq 0 , 4 . } \\\\ & { \\tan ^ { - 1 } \\displaystyle \\left( \\displaystyle \\frac { \\cos x - \\sin x } { \\cos x + \\sin x } \\right) , \\displaystyle \\frac { - \\pi } { 4 } < x < \\displaystyle \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 4 } } \\\\ & { \\tan ^ { - 1 } \\displaystyle \\frac { x } { \\sqrt { a ^ { 2 } - x ^ { 2 } } } , | x | < a } \\\\ & { \\tan ^ { - 1 } \\displaystyle \\left( \\displaystyle \\frac { 3 a ^ { 2 } x - x ^ { 3 } } { a ^ { 3 } - 3 a ^ { 2 } } \\right) , a > 0 , \\displaystyle \\frac { - a } { \\sqrt { 3 } } < x < \\displaystyle \\frac { a } { \\sqrt { 3 } } } \\end{array}$ tan- 1-cosx ,0<x<π   \n5.   \n6 \n\nFind the values of each ofthe following: \n\nFind the values of each of the expressions in Exercises 16 to 18. \n\n11 $\\tan ^ { - 1 } \\left( \\tan { \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 4 } } \\right)$ \n\n13 $\\cos ^ { - 1 } \\left( \\cos { \\frac { 7 \\pi } { 6 } } \\right)$ \n\n（A) $\\frac { 7 \\pi } { 6 }$ $\\frac { 5 \\pi } { 6 }$ （C） (D)\n\n14. $\\sin \\left( { \\frac { \\pi } { 3 } } - \\sin ^ { - 1 } ( - { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } ) \\right)$ \n\n$\\frac { 1 } { 2 }$ C (D）1\n\n15. $\\tan ^ { - 1 } { \\sqrt { 3 } } - \\cot ^ { - 1 } ( - { \\sqrt { 3 } } )$ is equal to \n\n(A）π B (D） 2√3\n\nMiscellaneous Examples \n\nExample 6 Find the value of $\\sin ^ { - 1 } ( \\sin \\frac { 3 \\pi } { 5 } )$ \n\nSolution We know that $\\sin ^ { - 1 } ( \\sin x ) = x$ .

The ancient Indian Mathematicians, Aryabhata (476A.D.), Brahmagupta (598 A.D.), Bhaskara I (600 A.D.) and Bhaskara II(1i14 A.D.) got important results of trigonometry. All this knowledge went from India to Arabia and then from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the study of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian approach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world. \n\nIn India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents one of the main contribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to mathematics. \n\nBhaskara I(about 6Oo A.D.) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions for angles more than $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa contains a proof for the expansion of sin $\\left( \\mathsf { A } + \\mathsf { B } \\right)$ . Exact expression for sines or cosines of $1 8 ^ { \\circ }$ ， $3 6 ^ { \\circ }$ ， $5 4 ^ { \\circ }$ $7 2 ^ { \\circ }$ , etc., were given by Bhaskara II. \n\nThe symbols $\\sin ^ { - 1 } x$ ， $\\cos ^ { - 1 } { x } ,$ etc., for arc $\\sin x .$ arc $\\cos x ,$ etc., were suggested by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The name of Thales (about $6 0 0 \\mathrm { B . C . }$ ) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known height, and comparing the ratios: \n\nThales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through the proportionality of sides of similar triangles.Problems on height and distance using the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.",

    "content": "The essence of Mathematics lies in its freedom. - CANTOR \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nThe knowledge of matrices is necessary in various branches of mathematics.Matrices are one of the most powerful tools in mathematics. This mathematical tool simplifies our work to a great extent when compared with other straight forward methods. The evolution of concept of matrices is the result of an attempt to obtain compact and simple methods of solving system of linear equations. Matrices are not only used as a representation of the coefficients in system of linear equations, but utility of matrices far exceeds that use.Matrix notation and operations are used in electronic spreadsheet programs for personal computer, which in turn is used in different areas of business and science like budgeting, sales projection, cost estimation, analysing the results of an experiment etc. Also, many physical operations such as magnification, rotation and reflection through a plane can be represented mathematically by matrices. Matrices are also used in cryptography. This mathematical tool is not only used in certain branches of sciences, but also in genetics, economics, sociology,modern psychology and industrial management. \n\nIn this chapter, we shall find it interesting to become acquainted with the fundamentals of matrix and matrix algebra. \n\n3.2 Matrix \n\nSuppose we wish to express the information that Radha has 15 notebooks. We may express it as [15] with the understanding that the number inside[] is the number of notebooks that Radha has. Now, if we have to express that Radha has 15 notebooks and 6 pens.We may express it as [15 6] with the understanding that first number inside[] is the number of notebooks while the other one is the number ofpens possessed by Radha. Let us now suppose that we wish to express the information of possession of notebooks and pens by Radha and her two friends Fauzia and Simran which is as follows: \n\nRadha has 15 notebooks and 6 pens, Fauzia has 10 notebooks and 2 pens, Simran has 13 notebooks and 5 pens. \n\nNow this could be arranged in the tabular form as follows: \n\nand this can be expressed as \n\n15 First row NCERT Second row Third row 个 First Second Column Column \n\nor \n\n? \n\nRadha \n\nNotebooks 10 13   \nPens 2 5 \n\nwhich can be expressed as: \n\n15 10 13 First row 6 2 5 $\\gets$ Second row → → → First Second Third Column Column Column \n\nIn the first arrangement the entries in the first column represent the number of note books possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively and the entries in the second column represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively. Similarly,in the second arrangement, the entries in the first row represent the number of notebooks possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively. The entries in the second row represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively. An arrangement or display of the above kind is called a matrix. Formally, we define matrix as: \n\nDefinition 1 A matrix is an ordered rectangular array of numbers or functions. The numbers or functions are called the elements or the entries of the matrix. \n\nWe denote matrices by capital letters.The following are some examples of matrices: \n\nIn the above examples, the horizontal lines of elements are said to constitute, rows of the matrix and the vertical lines of elements are said to constitute, columns of the matrix. Thus A has 3 rows and 2 columns, B has 3 rows and 3 columns while C has 2 rows and 3 columns. \n\n3.2.1 Order of a matrix \n\nA matrix having m rows and n columns is called a matrix of order $m \\times n$ or simply $m \\times n$ matrix (read as an m by $n$ matrix). So referring to the above examples of matrices, we have A as $3 \\times 2$ matrix, B as $3 \\times 3$ matrix and C as $2 \\times 3$ matrix.We observe that A has $3 \\times 2 = 6$ elements, B and C have 9 and 6 elements, respectively. \n\nIn general, an $m \\times n$ matrix has the following rectangular array: \n\nor $\\mathrm { A } = [ a _ { i j } ] _ { m \\times n } , 1 \\leq i \\leq m , 1 \\leq j \\leq n i , j \\in \\mathrm { N }$ \n\nThus the $i ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ row consists of the elements $a _ { { } _ { i 1 } } , a _ { { } _ { i 2 } } , a _ { { } _ { i 3 } } { } _ { \\cdots } , a _ { { } _ { i n } } ,$ while the $j ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ column consists of the elements alj, a2j, aj., ämj \n\nIn general $a _ { _ { i j } } ^ { \\phantom { } } ,$ is an element lying in the $i ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ row and $j ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ column. We can also call it as the $( i , j ) ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ element of A. The number of elements in an $m \\times n$ matrix will be equal to mn. \n\nNote In this chapter \n\n1.We shalfollow the notation,amely $\\mathbf { A } = [ a _ { i j } ] _ { m \\times n }$ to indicate that A is a matrix of order $m \\times n$   \n2. We shall consider only those matrices whose elements are real numbers or functions taking real values. \n\nWe can also represent any point $( x , y )$ in a plane by a matrix (column or row) as $\\left[ \\begin{array} { l } { x } \\\\ { y } \\end{array} \\right] ( \\mathrm { o r } [ x , y ] )$ Tor exmpl giat $\\mathrm { P } ( 0 , 1 )$ \n\nObserve that in this way we can also express the vertices of a closed rectilinear figure in the form of a matrix. For example, consider a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices A (1, 0),B (3,2),C(1, 3),D $( - 1 , 2 )$ \n\nNow, quadrilateral ABCD in the matrix form, can be represented as \n\nThus, matrices can be used as representation of vertices of geometrical figures in a plane. \n\nNow, let us consider some examples. \n\nExample 1 Consider the following information regarding the number of men and women workers in three factories I, II and III \n\nRepresent the above information in the form of a $3 \\times 2$ matrix. What does the entry in the third row and second column represent? \n\nSolution The information is represented in the form of a $3 \\times 2$ matrix as follows: \n\nThe entry in the third row and second column represents the number of women workers in factory III. \n\nExample 2 If a matrix has 8 elements, what are the possible orders it can have? \n\nSolution We know that if a matrix is of order $m \\times n$ ,it has mn elements.Thus,to find all possible orders of a matrix with 8 elements, we will find all ordered pairs of natural numbers, whose product is 8. \n\nThus, all possible ordered pairs are $( 1 , 8 ) , ( 8 , 1 ) , ( 4 , 2 ) , ( 2 , 4 )$ \n\nHence,possible orders are $1 \\times 8$ $8 \\times 1$ $4 \\times 2 , 2 \\times 4$ \n\nExample 3 Construct a3 × 2 matrix whose elements are given by dj = $a _ { i j } = \\frac { 1 } { 2 } | i - 3 j |$ \n\nSolution In general a $3 \\times 2$ matrix is given by $\\begin{array} { r } { \\mathrm { A } = \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { a _ { 1 1 } } & { a _ { 1 2 } } \\\\ { a _ { 2 1 } } & { a _ { 2 2 } } \\\\ { a _ { 3 1 } } & { a _ { 3 2 } } \\end{array} \\right] . } \\end{array}$ \n\nNow \n\nTherefore \n\nHence the required matrix is given by $\\mathbf { A } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 1 } & { { \\frac { 5 } { 2 } } } \\\\ { { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } } & { 2 } \\\\ { 0 } & { { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } } \\end{array} \\right] } .$ \n\n3.3 Types of Matrices \n\nIn this section, we shall discuss different types of matrices. \n\n(i) Column matrix \n\nA matrix is said to be a column matrix if it has only one column. \n\n0 √3 For example, $\\mathbf { A } = { \\harpoonright _ { - 1 } }$ is a column matrix of order $4 \\times 1$ [1/2] \n\nIn general, $\\mathrm { \\bf A } = [ a _ { i j } ] _ { m \\times 1 }$ is a column matrix of order $m \\times 1$ \n\n(ii) Row matrix \n\nA matrix is said to be a row matrix if it has only one row. For example, $B = \\left[ - \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\sqrt { 5 } 2 3 \\right] _ { 1 }$ is a row matrix. ×4 In general, $\\mathrm { B } = [ b _ { i j } ] _ { 1 \\times n }$ is a row matrix of order $1 \\times n$ \n\n(ii) Square matrix \n\nA matrix in which the number of rows are equal to the number of columns, is said to be a square matrix. Thus an $m \\times n$ matrix is said to be a square matrix if $m = n$ and is known as a square matrix of order $ { { ^ \\circ } n \\mathrm { ~ } }$ \n\n3 For example A = 3 3√2 is a square matrix of order 3. 2 4 -1 \n\nIn genera, $\\mathbf { A } = [ a _ { i j } ] _ { m \\times m }$ is a square matrix of order $m$ $\\overline { { \\mathbf { 1 0 t e } } } \\mathrm { [ f } \\mathbf { A } = [ a _ { i j } ]$ is a square matrix of order $n$ , then elements (entries) $a _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 1 1 } , a _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 2 2 } , . . . , a _ { \\scriptscriptstyle n n }$ are said to constitute the diagonal, of the matrix A. Thus, if $\\begin{array} { r } { \\mathbf { A } = \\left[ \\begin{array} { c c c } { 1 } & { - 3 } & { 1 } \\\\ { 2 } & { 4 } & { - 1 } \\\\ { 3 } & { 5 } & { 6 } \\end{array} \\right] . } \\end{array}$ Then the elements of the diagonal of A are 1, 4, 6. \n\n(iv) Diagonal matrix \n\nA square matrix $\\mathrm { B } = [ b _ { i j } ] _ { m \\times m }$ is said tobeadiagonal matrix ifal its non diagonal elementsarezero,thatisamatrix B=i is said to be a diagonal matrix if $b _ { _ { i j } } = 0$ ,when $i \\neq j$ \n\nFor example, $\\begin{array} { r } { \\mathbf { A } = [ 4 ] , \\ \\mathbf { B } = \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { - 1 } & { 0 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 2 } \\end{array} \\right] , \\ \\mathbf { C } = \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l l } { - 1 . 1 } & { 0 } & { 0 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 2 } & { 0 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 0 } & { 3 } \\end{array} \\right] , } \\end{array}$ are diga aieses \n\nof order 1,2,3,respectively. \n\n(v) Scalar matrix \n\nA diagonal matrix is said to be a scalar matrix ifits diagonal elements are equa, that is,asquare matrixB=] is said to be a scalar matrix if \n\nFor example \n\nare calar matrices of order 1,2 and 3,respectively. \n\n(vi) Identity matrix \n\nA square matrix in which elements in the diagonal are all 1 and rest are all zero is called an identity matrix. In other words, the square matrix ${ \\bf A } = [ a _ { i j } ] _ { n \\times n }$ is an \n\nidentity matrix, if $a _ { i j } = \\left\\{ { \\begin{array} { l l l l l } { { 1 } } & { { \\mathrm { i f } } } & { { i = j } } \\\\ { { 0 } } & { { \\mathrm { i f } } } & { { i \\neq j } } \\end{array} } \\right. .$ \n\nWe denote the identity matrix of order $n$ by $\\mathrm { I } _ { n } .$ When order is clear from the context, we simply write it as I. \n\nFor example [1], ${ \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 1 } & { 0 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 1 } \\end{array} \\right] } , { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l l } { 1 } & { 0 } & { 0 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 1 } & { 0 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 0 } & { 1 } \\end{array} \\right] } .$ are identity matrices of order 1,2 and 3, respectively. \n\nObserve that a scalar matrix is an identity matrix when $k = 1$ But every identity matrix is clearly a scalar matrix. \n\n(vii) Zero matrix \n\nA matrix is said to be zero matrix or null matrix if all its elements are zero. For example,[0], [0 ${ \\left[ 0 \\quad 0 \\right] } , { \\left[ 0 \\quad 0 \\quad 0 \\right] } , \\left[ 0 , 0 \\right]$ 0o]'000],[O,0]are allzero matrices.We denote zero matrix by O. Its order will be clear from the context. \n\n3.3.1 Equality of matrices \n\nDefinition 2 Two matrices $\\mathrm { A } = [ a _ { i j } ]$ and $\\mathrm { B } = [ b _ { _ { i j } } ]$ are said to be equal if \n\n(i) they are of the same order   \n(ii)each element of A is equal to the corresponding element ofB, that is $a _ { _ { i j } } = b _ { _ { i j } }$ for all $i$ and $j$ \n\nFor example, $\\left[ { \\begin{array} { c c } { 2 } & { 3 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 1 } \\end{array} } \\right] { \\mathrm { { a n d } } } \\left[ { 2 } \\quad 3 \\right]$ are equal matrices but ${ \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 3 } & { 2 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 1 } \\end{array} \\right] } { \\mathrm { a n d } } { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 2 } & { 3 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 1 } \\end{array} \\right] }$ are not equal matrices. Symbolically, if two matrices A and B are equal, we write $\\mathrm { A } = \\mathrm { B }$ \n\nFind the values of $a , b , c , x , y$ and $z$ \n\nSolution As the given matrices are equal, therefore, their corresponding elements must be equal. Comparing the corresponding elements, we get \n\nSimplifying, we get \n\nExample 5 Find the values of $a , b , c ,$ and $d$ from the following equation: \n\nSolution By equality of two matrices, equating the corresponding elements, we get \n\nSolving these equations, we get \n\nEXERCISE 3.1 \n\n(i) The order of the matrix, (ii)  The number of elements, (ii) Write the elements al3, a21, a33, a24 a23 \n\n2. If a matrix has 24 elements, what are the possible orders it can have? What, if it has 13 elements? \n\n3. If a matrix has 18 elements, what are the possible orders it can have? What, if it has 5 elements? \n\n4. Construct a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, $\\mathrm { A } = [ a _ { i j } ]$ , whose elements are given by: \n\ni $a _ { i j } = \\frac { ( i + ( j ) ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \\quad \\quad ( \\mathrm { i i } ) \\quad a _ { i j } = \\frac { i } { j }$ $a _ { i j } = \\frac { ( i + 2 j ) ^ { 2 } } { 2 }$ \n\n5. Construct a $3 \\times 4$ matrix, whose elements are given by: \n\n6． Find the values of $x , y$ and $z$ from the following equations: \n\n7． Find the value of $a , b , c$ and $d$ from the equation: \n\n8. $\\mathbf { A } = \\left[ a _ { i j } \\right] _ { m \\times n | }$ is a square matrix, if \n\n(A) $\\ b { m } < \\ b { n } \\qquad \\mathrm { ( B ) } \\ \\ b { m } > \\ b { n }$ (C) $m = n$ (D） None of these\n\n9.

Each factory produces sport shoes for boys and girls in three different price categories labelled 1, 2 and 3. The quantities produced by each factory are represented as matrices given below: \n\nSuppose Fatima wants to know the total production of sport shoes in each price category.

Therefore, addition of A and B is defined and is given by \n\nNote \n\n1. We emphasise that if A and B are not of the same order, then $\\mathrm { A } + \\mathrm { B }$ is not defined.

We observe that, for multiplication of two matrices Aand B, the number of columns in A should be equal to the number of rows in B. Furthermore for geting the elements of the product matrix, we take rows of A and columns of B, multiply them element-wise and take the sum. Formally, we define multiplication of matrices as follows: \n\nThe product of two matrices A and B is defined if the number of columns of A is equal to the number of rows of B. Let $\\mathrm { A } = [ a _ { i j } ]$ be an $m \\times n$ matrix and $\\mathrm { B } = [ b _ { j k } ]$ be an $n \\times p$ matrix. Then the product of the matrices Aand B is the matrix C of order $m \\times p$ To get the $( i , k ) ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ element $c _ { _ { i k } }$ of the matrix C, we take the $i ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ row of A and $k ^ { \\mathrm { { t h } } }$ column of B, multiply them elementwise and take the sum of all these products. In other words, if $\\mathbf { A } = [ a _ { i j } ] _ { m \\times n } , \\mathbf { B } = [ b _ { j k } ] _ { n \\times p } ,$ then the $i ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ row of A is $[ a _ { i 1 } ^ { \\phantom { } } a _ { i 2 } ^ { \\phantom { } } \\dots a _ { i n } ^ { \\phantom { } } ]$ and the $k ^ { \\mathrm { { t h } } }$ column of \n\nThe matrix $\\mathrm { C } = \\left[ c _ { i k } \\right] _ { m \\times p }$ is the product of A and B. \n\nFor xapg. $\\mathbf { C } = \\left[ { \\begin{array} { r r r } { 1 } & { - 1 } & { 2 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 3 } & { 4 } \\end{array} } \\right]$ and $\\mathrm { D } = \\left[ { \\begin{array} { r r } { 2 } & { 7 } \\\\ { - 1 } & { 1 } \\\\ { 5 } & { - 4 } \\end{array} } \\right] .$ \n\nand is given by $\\mathrm { C D } = \\left[ { \\begin{array} { r r r } { 1 } & { - 1 } & { 2 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 3 } & { 4 } \\end{array} } \\right] \\left[ { \\begin{array} { r r } { 2 } & { 7 } \\\\ { - 1 } & { 1 } \\\\ { 5 } & { - 4 } \\end{array} } \\right] .$ Thisisa $2 \\times 2$ mati i whih eah \n\nentry is the sum of the products across some row of C with the corresponding entries down some column of D.

Hence AB is defined. Now \n\nRemark If AB is defined, then BA need not be defined. In the above example, AB is defined but BA is not defined because B has 3 column while A has only 2 (and not 3) rows. IfA,B are, respectively $m \\times n$ $k \\times l$ matrices, then both AB and BA are defined if and only if $n = k$ and $l = m$ . In particular, if both A and B are square matrices of the same order, then both AB and BA are defined. \n\nNon-commutativity of multiplication of matrices \n\nNow, we shall see by an example that even if AB and BA are both defined, it is not necessary that $\\mathrm { A B } = \\mathrm { B A }$ \n\nExample 3 1f $\\mathbf { A } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l l } { 1 } & { - 2 } & { 3 } \\\\ { - 4 } & { 2 } & { 5 } \\end{array} \\right] }$ and $\\mathbf { B } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l } { 2 } \\end{array} \\right. } 3 { \\sqrt { \\mathbf { B } } } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l } { } \\\\ { 4 } \\end{array} \\right. } 5$ then find AB, BA. Show that $\\mathrm { A B } \\neq \\mathrm { B A } .$ 1 -he \n\nSolution Since A is a $2 \\times 3$ matrix and $\\mathrm { B }$ is $3 \\times 2$ matrix. Hence AB and BA are both defined and are matrices of order $2 \\times 2$ and $3 \\times 3$ , respectively. Note that \n\nClearly $\\mathrm { A B } \\neq \\mathrm { B A }$ \n\nIn the above example both AB and BA are of different order and so $\\mathrm { A B } \\neq \\mathrm { B A }$ .But one may think that perhaps AB and BA could be the same if they were of the same order. But it is not so, here we give an example to show that even if AB and BA are of same order they may not be same. \n\nand \n\nThus matrix multiplication is not commutative. \n\nNote This does not mean that $\\mathrm { A B } \\neq \\mathrm { B A }$ for every pair of matrices A, B for which AB and BA, are defined. For instance, \n\nObserve that multiplication of diagonal matrices of same order will be commutative. \n\nZero matrix as the product of two non zero matrices \n\nWe know that, for real numbers $a$ $^ { b }$ if $a b = 0$ ,then either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ .This need not be true for matrices, we will observe this through an example. Y \n\nExample 15 Find AB, if $\\mathrm { A } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 0 } & { - 1 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 2 } \\end{array} \\right] }$ and $\\mathbf { B } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 3 } & { 5 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 0 } \\end{array} \\right] } .$ \n\nSolution We have $\\mathbf { A B } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 0 } & { - 1 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 2 } \\end{array} \\right] } { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 3 } & { 5 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 0 } \\end{array} \\right] } = { \\left[ \\begin{array} { l l } { 0 } & { 0 } \\\\ { 0 } & { 0 } \\end{array} \\right] } .$ \n\nThus, ifthe product of two matrices is a zero matrix, it is not necessary that one of the matrices is a zero matrix. \n\n3.4.6 Properties of multiplication of matrices \n\nThe multiplication of matrices possesses the following properties, which we state without proof. \n\n1. The associative law For any three matrices A, B and C. We have (AB) $\\mathrm { C } = \\mathrm { A }$ (BC), whenever both sides of the equality are defined. \n\n2.

Since for any matrix A, $( k \\mathrm { A } ) ^ { \\prime } = k \\mathrm { A } ^ { \\prime }$ , it follows that $\\frac { 1 } { 2 } ( \\mathbf { A } + \\mathbf { A } ^ { \\prime } )$ \n\nis symmetric matrix and $\\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\left( \\mathbf { A } - \\mathbf { A } ^ { \\prime } \\right)$ is skew symmetric matrix.

We shall show that $\\mathrm { B } = \\mathrm { C }$ 7 \n\nSince B is the inverse of A \n\nSince C is also the inverse of A \n\nThus \n\nTheorem 4 If A and B are invertible matrices of the same order, then $( \\mathrm { A B } ) ^ { - 1 } = \\mathrm { B } ^ { - 1 } \\mathrm { A } ^ { - 1 }$ \n\nProof From the definition of inverse of a matrix, we have \n\nor \n\nor \n\nHence \n\nEXERCISE 3.4 \n\n1.
