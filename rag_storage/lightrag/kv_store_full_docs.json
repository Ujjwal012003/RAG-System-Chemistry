Most of these are mixtures containing two or more pure substances. Their utility or importance in life depends on their composition. For example, the properties of brass (mixture of copper and zinc) are quite different from those of German silver (mixture of copper, zinc and nickel) or bronze (mixture of copper and tin); 1 part per million (ppm) of fluoride ions in water prevents tooth decay, while $1 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { p p m }$ causes the tooth to become mottled and high concentrations of fluoride ions can be poisonous (for example, sodium fluoride is used in rat poison); intravenous injections are always dissolved in water containing salts at particular ionic concentrations that match with blood plasma concentrations and so on. \n\nIn this Unit, we will consider mostly liquid solutions and their formation. This wil be followed by studying the properties of the solutions, like vapour pressure and colligative properties. We will begin with types of solutions and then various alternatives in which concentrations of a solute can be expressed in liquid solution. \n\nSolutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more than two components. By homogenous mixture we mean that its composition and properties are uniform throughout the mixture. Generally, the component that is present in the largest quantity is known as solvent. Solvent determines the physical state in which solution exists. One or more components present in the solution other than solvent are called solutes. In this Unit we shall consider only binary solutions (i.e., consisting of two components). Here each component may be solid, liquid or in gaseous state and are summarised in Table 1.1. \n\nComposition of a solution can be described by expressing its concentration. The latter can be expressed either qualitatively or quantitatively. For example, qualitatively we can say that the solution is dilute (i.e., relatively very small quantity of solute) or it is concentrated (i.e., relatively very large quantity of solute). But in real life these kinds of description can add to lot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description of the solution. \n\nThere are several ways by which we can describe the concentration of the solution quantitatively. \n\n(i) Mass percentage (w/w): The mass percentage of a component of a solution is defined as: Mass $\\%$ of a component \n\nFor example, if a solution is described by $1 0 \\%$ glucose in water by mass, it means that $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of glucose is dissolved in $9 0 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ of water resulting in a $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ solution. Concentration described by mass percentage is commonly used in industrial chemical applications. For example, commercial bleaching solution contains 3.62 mass percentage of sodium hypochlorite in water. \n\n(ii) Volume percentage $( V / V )$ : The volume percentage is defined as: Volume $\\%$ of a component $=$ Volume of the component ×100 Total volume of solution \n\nFor example, $1 0 \\%$ ethanol solution in water means that $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { \\ m L }$ of ethanol is dissolved in water such that the total volume of the solution is $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m L } }$ . Solutions containing liquids are commonly expressed in this unit. For example, a $3 5 \\% ~ ( v / v )$ solution of ethylene glycol, an antifreeze, is used in cars for cooling the engine. At this concentration the antifreeze lowers the freezing point of water to 255.4K $\\left( - 1 7 . 6 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } \\right)$ . \n\n(ii) Mass by volume percentage $( \\mathbf { w } / V )$ : Another unit which is commonly used in medicine and pharmacy is mass by volume percentage. It is the mass of solute dissolved in $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m L }$ of the solution. \n\n(iv) Parts per million: When a solute is present in trace quantities, it is convenient to express concentration in parts per million (ppm) and is defined as: \n\nParts per million $=$ \n\nAs in the case of percentage, concentration in parts per million can also be expressed as mass to mass, volume to volume and mass to volume. A litre of sea water (which weighs 1030 g) contains about $6 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of dissolved oxygen $\\left( \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } \\right)$ . Such a small concentration is also expressed as $5 . 8 \\textrm { g }$ per $1 0 ^ { 6 } \\ \\mathrm { \\ g }$ (cid:) $( 5 . 8 \\mathrm { \\ p p m } )$ of sea water. The concentration of pollutants in water or atmosphere is often expressed in terms of $\\mu \\mathrm { g } \\ \\bar { \\mathrm { m L } } ^ { - 1 }$ or ppm. \n\n(v) Mole fraction: Commonly used symbol for mole fraction is $x$ and subscript used on the right hand side of $x$ denotes the component. It is defined as: \n\nMole fraction of a component = \n\nNumber of moles of the component \n\nTotal number of moles of all the components \n\nFor example, in a binary mixture, if the number of moles of A and B are $n _ { \\mathrm { A } }$ and $n _ { \\mathrm { { B } } }$ respectively, the mole fraction of A will be \n\nFor a solution containing i number of components, we have: \n\nIt can be shown that in a given solution sum of all the mole fractions is unity, i.e. \n\nMole fraction unit is very useful in relating some physical properties of solutions, say vapour pressure with the concentration of the solution and quite useful in describing the calculations involving gas mixtures. \n\nExample 1.1 \n\nCalculate the mole fraction of ethylene glycol $\\mathrm { ( C _ { 2 } H _ { 6 } O _ { 2 } ) }$ in a solution containing $2 0 \\%$ of $\\mathrm { C _ { 2 } H _ { 6 } O _ { 2 } }$ by mass. \n\nSolution Assume that we have $1 0 0 \\mathrm { g }$ of solution (one can start with any amount of solution because the results obtained will be the same). Solution will contain $2 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of ethylene glycol and $8 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of water. \n\nMolar mass of $\\mathrm { C _ { 2 } H _ { 6 } O _ { 2 } } = 1 2 \\times 2 + 1 \\times 6 + 1 6 \\times 2 = 6 2 \\mathrm { g \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ \n\nMoles of C2HO2 = $\\mathrm { C _ { 2 } H _ { 6 } O _ { 2 } = \\frac { 2 0 \\ g } { 6 2 \\ g \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } } = 0 . 3 2 2 \\ m o l }$ \n\nMoles of water $= { \\frac { 8 0 \\ \\mathrm { g } } { 1 8 \\ \\mathrm { g } \\ \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 } } } = 4 . 4 4 4 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }$ \n\nSimilarly, $x _ { \\mathrm { w a t e r } } = { \\frac { 4 . 4 4 4 ~ { \\bmod { } } ~ } { 0 . 3 2 2 ~ { \\bmod { } } ~ + ~ 4 . 4 4 4 ~ { \\bmod { } } ~ } } = 0 . 9 3 2$ Mole fraction of water can also be calculated as: $1 - 0 . 0 6 8 = 0 . 9 3 2$ \n\n(vi) Molarity: Molarity $[ M ]$ is defined as number of moles of solute dissolved in one litre (or one cubic decimetre) of solution, \n\nFor example, $0 . 2 5 \\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 }$ (or $0 . 2 5 \\mathrm { M }$ solution of NaOH means that 0.25 mol of NaOH has been dissolved in one litre (or one cubic decimetre). \n\nExample 1.2 \n\nCalculate the molarity of a solution containing $5 \\mathrm { g }$ of NaOH in 450 mL solution. \n\nSolution \n\nMoles of $\\mathrm { N a O H } = { \\frac { 5 \\mathrm { g } } { 4 0 \\mathrm { g } { \\mathrm { m o l } } ^ { - 1 } } } = 0 . 1 2 5 { \\mathrm { m o l } }$ \n\nVolume of the solution in litres $= 4 5 0 \\mathrm { m L } / 1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { m L L } ^ { - 1 }$ Using equation (2.8), \n\n(vii) Molality: Molality $( m )$ is defined as the number of moles of the solute per kilogram $\\mathrm { ( k g ) }$ of the solvent and is expressed as: \n\nFor example, $1 . 0 0 \\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 }$ (or $1 . 0 0 \\mathrm { m } )$ solution of KCl means that 1 mol (74.5 g) of KCl is dissolved in $1 ~ \\mathrm { k g }$ of water. \n\nEach method of expressing concentration of the solutions has its own merits and demerits. Mass $\\%$ , ppm, mole fraction and molality are independent of temperature, whereas molarity is a function of temperature. This is because volume depends on temperature and the mass does not. \n\nCalculate molality of $2 . 5 \\mathrm { g }$ of ethanoic acid $\\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } C O O H ) }$ in $7 5 \\mathrm { g }$ of benzene.

It depends upon the nature of solute and solvent as well as temperature and pressure. Let us consider the effect of these factors in solution of a solid or a gas in a liquid. \n\n1.3.1 Solubility of a Solid in a Liquid \n\nEvery solid does not dissolve in a given liquid. while sodium chloride and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do not. On the other hand, naphthalene and anthracene dissolve readily in benzene but sodium chloride and sugar do not. It is observed that polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents and non polar solutes in nonpolar solvents. In general, a solute dissolves in a solvent if the intermolecular interactions are similar in the two or we may say like dissolves like. \n\nwhen a solid solute is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves and its concentration increases in solution. This process is known as dissolution. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute particles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as crystallisation. A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the same rate. Under such conditions, number of 'solute particles going into solution will be equal to the solute particles separating out and a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached. \n\nSolute $^ +$ Solvent Solution \n\nAt this stage the concentration of solute in solution will remain constant under the given conditions, i.e., temperature and pressure. Similar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents. Such a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature and pressure is called a saturated solution. An unsaturated solution is one in which more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium with undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the maximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent. Thus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility. \n\nEarlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into another depends on the nature of the substances. In addition to these variables, two other parameters, i.e., temperature and pressure also control this phenomenon. \n\nEffect of temperature \n\nThe solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature changes. Consider the equilibrium represented by equation 1.10. This, being dynamic equilibrium, must follow Le Chateliers Principle. In general, if in a nearly saturated solution, the dissolution process is endothermic $( \\Delta _ { \\mathrm { s o l } } \\ \\mathrm { ~ H ~ } > \\ 0 )$ , the solubility should increase with rise in temperature and if it is exothermic $( \\Delta _ { \\mathrm { s o l } } \\ \\mathrm { H } < 0 )$ the solubility should decrease. These trends are also observed experimentally. \n\nEffect of pressure \n\nPressure does not have any significant effect on solubility of solids in liquids. It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible and practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure. \n\n1.3.2 Solubility of a Gas in a Liquid \n\nMany gases dissolve in water. Oxygen dissolves only to a small extent in water. It is this dissolved oxygen which sustains all aquatic life. On the other hand, hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) is highly soluble in water. Solubility of gases in liquids is greatly affected by pressure and temperature. The solubility of gases increase with increase of pressure. For solution of gases in a solvent, consider a system as shown in Fig. 1.1 (a). The lower part is solution and the upper part is gaseous system at pressure $p$ and temperature $T .$ Assume this system to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of gaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same. Now increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the gas to a smaller volume [Fig. 1.1 (b)]. This will increase the number of gaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate at which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to enter it. The solubility of the gas will increase until a new equilibrium is reached resulting in an increase in the pressure of a gas above the solution and thus its solubility increases. \n\nHenry was the first to give a quantitative relation between pressure and solubility of a gas in a solvent which is known as Henry's law. The law states that at a constant temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas present above the surface of liquid or solution. Dalton, a contemporary of Henry, also concluded independently that the solubility of a gas in a liquid solution is a function of partial pressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in the solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be said that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over the solution. The most commonly used form of Henry's law states that \"the partial pressure of the gas in vapour phase $\\pmb { \\left[ p \\right] }$ is proportional to the mole fraction of the gas $\\pmb { \\left\\{ x \\right\\} }$ in the solution\" and is expressed as: \n\nHere $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ is the Henry's law constant. If we draw a graph between partial pressure of the gas versus mole fraction of the gas in solution, then we should get a plot of the type as shown in Fig. 1.2. \n\nDifferent gases have different $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ values at the same temperature (Table 1.2). This suggests that $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ is a function of the nature of the gas. \n\nIt is obvious from equation (1.11) that higher the value of $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ at a given pressure, the lower is the solubility of the gas in the liquid. It can be seen from Table 1.2 that $\\mathrm { K } _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ values for both $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { { O } } _ { 2 }$ increase with increase of temperature indicating that the solubility of gases increases with decrease of temperature. It is due to this reason that aquatic species are more comfortable in cold waters rather than in warm waters. - \n\nExample 1.4 $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ gas is bubbled through water at $2 9 3 \\ \\mathrm { K }$ , how many millimoles of $\\mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ gas would dissolve in 1 litre of water? Assume that $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ exerts a partial pressure of O.987 bar. Given that Henry's law constant for $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ at 293 K is 76.48 kbar. - \n\nSolution The solubility of gas is related to the mole fraction in aqueous solution. The mole fraction of the gas in the solution is calculated by applying Henry's law. Thus: \n\nAs 1 litre of water contains $5 5 . 5 \\mathrm { m o l }$ of it, therefore if $n$ represents number of moles of $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ in solution, \n\n$x \\left( { \\mathrm { N i t r o g e n } } \\right) = { \\frac { n { \\mathrm { ~ m o l ~ } } } { n { \\mathrm { ~ m o l } } + 5 5 . 5 { \\mathrm { ~ m o l } } } } = { \\frac { n } { 5 5 . 5 } } = 1 . 2 9 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ (cd $n$ in denominator is neglected as it is $< < 5 5 . 5 ]$ (id:) Thus $n = 1 . 2 9 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \\times 5 5 . 5 \\mathrm { m o l } = 7 . 1 6 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \\mathrm { m o l }$ $= { \\frac { 7 . 1 6 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { - 4 } { \\mathrm { ~ m o l } } \\times 1 0 0 0 { \\mathrm { ~ m m o l } } } { \\mathrm { 1 ~ m o l } } } = 0 . 7 1 6 { \\mathrm { ~ m m o l } }$ \n\nHenry's law finds several applications in industry and explains some biological phenomena. Notable among these are: \n\n• To increase the solubility of $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in soft drinks and soda water, the bottle is sealed under high pressure. • Scuba divers must cope with high concentrations of dissolved gases while breathing air at high pressure underwater. Increased pressure increases the solubility of atmospheric gases in blood. when the divers come towards surface, the pressure gradually decreases. This releases the dissolved gases and leads to the formation of bubbles of nitrogen in the blood. This blocks capillaries and creates a medical condition known as bends, which are painful and dangerous to life. \n\nTo avoid bends, as well as, the toxic effects of high concentrations of nitrogen in the blood, the tanks used by scuba divers are filled with air diluted with helium $. 1 1 . 7 \\%$ helium, $5 6 . 2 \\%$ nitrogen and $3 2 . 1 \\%$ oxygen). \n\n• At high altitudes the partial pressure of oxygen is less than that at the ground level. This leads to low concentrations of oxygen in the blood and tissues of people living at high altitudes or climbers. Low blood oxygen causes climbers to become weak and unable to think clearly, symptoms of a condition known as anoxia. \n\nEffect of Temperature \n\nSolubility of gases in liquids decreases with rise in temperature. when dissolved, the gas molecules are present in liquid phase and the process of dissolution can be considered similar to condensation and heat is evolved in this process. We have learnt in the last Section that dissolution process involves dynamic equilibrium and thus must follow Le Chatelier's Principle. As dissolution is an exothermic process, the solubility should decrease with increase of temperature. \n\nIntexct Questions \n\n1.6 ${ \\mathrm { H } } _ { 2 } { \\mathsf { S } } _ { \\mathsf { \\ell } }$ , a toxic gas with rotten egg like smell, is used for the qualitative analysis. If the solubility of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S }$ in water at STP is $0 . 1 9 5 \\mathrm { m }$ , calculate Henry's law constant. \n\n1.7 Henry's law constant for $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in water is $1 . 6 7 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ Pa at 298 K. Calculate the quantity of $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in $5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m L }$ of soda water when packed under 2.5 atm $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ pressure at 298 K. \n\n1.4 Vapour Oressure of Liquid Solutions \n\nLiquid solutions are formed when solvent is a liquid. The solute can be a gas, a liquid or a solid. Solutions of gases in liquids have already been discussed in Section 1.3.2. In this Section, we shall discuss the solutions of liquids and solids in a liquid. Such solutions may contain one or more volatile components. Generally, the liquid solvent is volatile. The solute may or may not be volatile. We shall discuss the properties of only binary solutions, that is, the solutions containing two components, namely, the solutions of (i) liquids in liquids and (i) solids in liquids. \n\n1.4.1 Vapour Pressure of LiquidLiquid Solutions \n\nLet us consider a binary solution of two volatile liquids and denote the two components as 1 and 2. when taken in a closed vessel, both the components would evaporate and eventually an equilibrium would be established between vapour phase and the liquid phase. Let the total vapour pressure at this stage be $p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } }$ and $p _ { 1 }$ and $p _ { 2 }$ be the partial vapour pressures of the two components 1 and 2 respectively. These partial pressures are related to the mole fractions $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ of the two components 1 and 2 respectively. \n\nThe French chemist, Francois Marte Raoult (1886) gave the quantitative relationship between them. The relationship is known as the Raoult's law which states that for a solution of volatile liquids, the partial vapour pressure of each component of the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction present in solution. \n\nThus, for component 1 an $\\begin{array} { r l } & { p _ { 1 } \\propto x _ { 1 } } \\\\ { \\textrm { d } } & { p _ { 1 } = \\ p _ { 1 } ^ { 0 } \\ x _ { 1 } } \\end{array}$ \n\nwhere $p _ { 1 } ^ { 0 }$ is the vapour pressure of pure component 1 at the same temperature. \n\nSimilarly, for component 2 \n\nwhere ${ p _ { 2 } } ^ { 0 }$ represents the vapour pressure of the pure component 2. \n\nAccording to Dalton's law of partial pressures, the total pressure $( p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } } )$ over the solution phase in the container will be the sum of the partial pressures of the components of the solution and is given as: \n\nSubstituting the values of $p _ { 1 }$ and $p _ { 2 }$ , we get \n\nFollowing conclusions can be drawn from equation (1.16). \n\n(i) Total vapour pressure over the solution can be related to the mole fraction of any one component. \n\n(ii) Total vapour pressure over the solution varies linearly with the mole fraction of component 2. \n\n(ii) Depending on the vapour pressures of the pure components 1 and 2, total vapour pressure over the solution decreases or increases with the increase of the mole fraction of component 1. \n\nA plot of $p _ { 1 }$ or $p _ { 2 }$ versus the mole fractions $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ for a solution gives a linear plot as shown in Fig. 1.3. These lines (I and I) pass through the points for which $x _ { 1 }$ and $x _ { 2 }$ are equal to unity. Similarly the plot (line II) of $p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } }$ versus $x _ { 2 }$ is also linear (Fig. 1.3). The minimum value of $p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } }$ is ${ p _ { 1 } } ^ { 0 }$ and the maximum value is ${ p _ { 2 } } ^ { 0 }$ , assuming that component 1 is less volatile than component 2, i.e., ${ p _ { 1 } } ^ { 0 } < { p _ { 2 } } ^ { 0 }$ \n\nThe composition of vapour phase in equilibrium with the solution is determined by the partial pressures of the components. If $y _ { 1 }$ and $y _ { 2 }$ are the mole fractions of the components 1 and 2 respectively in the vapour phase then, using Dalton's law of partial pressures: \n\nIn general \n\nExample 1.5 \n\nVapour pressure of chloroform $\\mathrm { \\ t C H C l _ { 3 } } )$ and dichloromethane $\\mathrm { [ C H _ { 2 } C l _ { 2 } ] }$ at 298 K are $2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m \\ H g }$ and $4 1 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m \\ H g }$ respectively. (i) Calculate the vapour pressure of the solution prepared by mixing $2 5 . 5 \\textrm { g }$ of $\\mathrm { C H C l } _ { 3 }$ and $4 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ at 298 K and, (i) mole fractions of each component in vapour phase. \n\nTotal number of moles $= 0 . 4 7 + 0 . 2 1 3 = 0 . 6 8 3 ~ \\mathrm { m o l }$ \n\nUsing equation (2.16), \n\n(ii) Using the relation (2.19), $y _ { \\mathrm { { i } } } = p _ { \\mathrm { { i } } } / p _ { \\mathrm { { t o t a l } } }$ we can calculate the mole fraction of the components in gas phase $\\left( y _ { \\mathrm { i } } \\right)$ . \n\n$p _ { \\mathrm { C H _ { 2 } C l _ { 2 } } } = 0 . 6 8 8 \\times 4 1 5 \\mathrm { ~ m m ~ H g } = 2 8 5 . 5 \\mathrm { ~ m m ~ H g }$ $p _ { \\mathrm { C H C l _ { 3 } } } ~ = ~ 0 . 3 1 2 ~ \\times ~ 2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m ~ H g } ~ = ~ 6 2 . 4 ~ \\mathrm { m m ~ H g }$ $\\begin{array} { r l } & { y _ { \\mathrm { C H _ { 2 } C l _ { 2 } } } = 2 8 5 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\ \\mathrm { H g } / 3 4 7 . 9 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\ \\mathrm { H g } = 0 . 8 2 } \\\\ & { y _ { \\mathrm { C H C l _ { 3 } } } = 6 2 . 4 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\ \\mathrm { H g } / 3 4 7 . 9 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\ \\mathrm { H g } = 0 . 1 8 } \\end{array}$ (cid:) \n\nNote: Since, $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ is a more volatile component than $\\mathrm { C H C l } _ { 3 }$ , $\\mathrm { \\Gamma } [ p _ { \\mathrm { C H _ { 2 } C l _ { 2 } } } ^ { o } =$ (cid:) $4 1 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m \\ H g }$ and $p _ { \\mathrm { C H C l _ { 3 } } } ^ { o } = 2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m \\ H g } ]$ and the vapour phase is also richer in $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ (cid:) $\\mathrm { \\Delta } [ y _ { \\mathrm { C H _ { 2 } C l _ { 2 } } } = \\ 0 . 8 2$ and $y _ { \\mathrm { C H C l _ { 3 } } } = \\ 0 . 1 8 ]$ , it may thus be concluded that at equilibrium, vapour phase will be always rich in the component which is more volatile. \n\n1.4.2 Raoult's Law as a special case of Henry's Law \n\nAccording to Raoult's law, the vapour pressure of a volatile component in a given solution is given by $p _ { \\mathrm { { i } } } ^ { \\mathrm { { - } } } = x _ { \\mathrm { { i } } } ^ { \\mathrm { { } } } { p _ { \\mathrm { { i } } } ^ { \\mathrm { { 0 } } } }$ . In the solution of a gas in a liquid, one of the components is so volatile that it exists as a gas and we have already seen that its solubility is given by Henry's law which states that \n\nIf we compare the equations for Raoult's law and Henry's law, it can be seen that the partial pressure of the volatile component or gas is directly proportional to its mole fraction in solution. Only the proportionality constant $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ diff ers from ${ p _ { 1 } } ^ { 0 }$ . Thus, Raoult's law becomes a special case of Henry's law in which $K _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ becomes equal to ${ p _ { 1 } } ^ { 0 }$ . \n\n1.4.3 Vapour Pressure of Solutions of Solids in Liquids \n\nAnother important class of solutions consists of solids dissolved in liquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and cane sugar in water and iodine and sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide. Some physical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of pure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. Liquids at a given temperature vapourise and under equilibrium conditions the pressure exerted by the vapours of the liquid over the liquid phase is called vapour pressure [Fig. 1.4 (a)]. In 1a pure liquid the entire surface is occupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a non-volatile solute is added to a solvent to give a solution [Fig. 1.4.(b)], the vapour pressure of the solution is solely from the solvent alone. This vapour pressure of the solution at a given temperature is found to be lower than the vapour pressure of the pure solvent at the same temperature. In the solution, the surface has both solute and solvent molecules; thereby the fraction of the surface covered by the solvent molecules gets reduced. Consequently, the number of solvent molecules escaping from the surface is correspondingly reduced, thus, the vapour pressure is also reduced. \n\nThe decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the quantity of non-volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of its nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by adding $1 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }$ of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that produced by adding $1 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }$ of urea to the same quantity of water at the same temperature. \n\nRaoult's law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction. \n\nIn a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by 2. When the solute is non-volatile, only the solvent molecules are present in vapour phase and contribute to vapour pressure. Let $p _ { 1 }$ be the vapour pressure of the solvent, $x _ { 1 }$ be its mole fraction, ${ p } _ { \\mathrm { i } } ^ { 0 }$ be its vapour pressure in the pure state. Then according to Raoult's law \n\nThe proportionality constant is equal to the vapour pressure of pure solvent, $p _ { 1 } ^ { 0 }$ ; A plot between the vapour pressure and the mole fraction of the solvent is linear (Fig. 1.5). \n\n1.5 Ideal and Nonideal Solutions \n\n1.5.1 Ideal Solutions \n\nLiquid-liquid solutions can be classified into ideal and non-ideal solutions on the basis of Raoult's law. - \n\nThe solutions which obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration are known as ideal solutions. The ideal solutions have two other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the pure components to form the solution is zero and the volume of mixing is also zero, i.e., \n\nIt means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components are mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of volumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of the solutions can be explained by considering two components A and B. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will be of types A-A and B-B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition to these two interactions, A-B type of interactions will also be present. If the intermolecular attractive forces between the A-A and B-B are nearly equal to those between A-B, this leads to the formation of ideal solution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly ideal in behaviour. Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane, bromoethane and chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. fall into this category. \n\n1.5.2 Non-ideal Solutions \n\nWhen a solution does not obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration, then it is called non-ideal solution. The vapour pressure of such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by Raoult's law (equation 1.16). If it is higher, the solution exhibits positive deviation and if it is lower, it exhibits negative deviation from Raoult's law. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions for such solutions are shown in Fig. 1.6. \n\nThe cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the molecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult's law, A-B interactions are weaker than those between A-A or B-B, i.e., in this case the intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules are weaker than those between the solute-solute and solvent-solvent molecules. This means that in such solutions, molecules of A (or B) will find it easier to escape than in pure state. This will increase the vapour pressure and result in positive deviation. Mixtures of ethanol and acetone behave in this manner. In pure ethanol, molecules are hydrogen bonded. On adding acetone, its molecules get in between the host molecules and break some of the hydrogen bonds between them. Due to weakening of interactions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult's law [Fig. 1.6 (a)]. In a solution formed by adding carbon disulphide to acetone, the dipolar interactions between solute-solvent molecules are weaker than the respective interactions among the solute-solute and solvent-solvent molecules. This solution also shows positive deviation. \n\nIn case of negative deviations from Raoult's law, the intermolecular attractive forces between A-A and B-B are weaker than those between A-B and leads to decrease in vapour pressure resulting in negative deviations. An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline. In this case the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic proton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the respective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar molecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone forms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult's law. This is because chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen bond with acetone molecule as shown. \n\nThis decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each component and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting in negative deviation from Raoult's law [Fig. 1.6. (b)]. \n\nSome liquids on mixing, form azeotropes which are binary mixtures having the same composition in liquid and vapour phase and boil at a constant temperature. In such cases, it is not possible to separate the components by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes called minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling azeotrope. The solutions which show a large positive deviation from Raoult's law form minimum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. \n\nFor example, ethanol-water mixture (obtained by fermentation of sugars) on fractional distillation gives a solution containing approximately $9 5 \\%$ by volume of ethanol. Once this composition, known as azeotrope composition, has been achieved, the liquid and vapour have the same composition, and no further separation occurs. \n\nThe solutions that show large negative deviation from Raoult's law form maximum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. Nitric acid and water is an example of this class of azeotrope. This azeotrope has the approximate composition, $6 8 \\%$ nitric acid and $3 2 \\%$ water by mass, with a boiling point of 393.5 K. \n\nIntext Question \n\n1.8 The vapour pressure of pure liquids A and B are 450 and $7 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m \\ H g }$ respectively, at 350 K . Find out the composition of the liquid mixture if total vapour pressure is $6 0 0 \\mathrm { m m H g }$ Also find the composition of the vapour phase. \n\n1.6 Colligative Properties and Determination of Molar Mass \n\nWe have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of solution decreases when a non-volatile solute is added to a volatile solvent. There are many properties of solutions which are connected with this decrease of vapour pressure. These are: (1) relative lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent (2) depression of freezing point of the solvent (3) elevation of boiling point of the solvent and (4) osmotic pressure of the solution. All these properties depend on the number of solute particles irrespective of their nature relative to the total number of particles present in the solution. Such properties are called colligative properties (colligative: from Latin: co means together, ligare means to bind). In the following Sections we will discuss these properties one by one. \n\n1.6.1 Relative Lowering of Vapour Pressure \n\nWe have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of a solvent in solution is less than that of the pure solvent. Raoult established that the lowering of vapour pressure depends only on the concentration of the solute particles and it is independent of their identity. The equation (1.20) given in Section 1.4.3 establishes a relation between vapour pressure of the solution, mole fraction and vapour pressure of the solvent, i.e., \n\nThe reduction in the vapour pressure of solvent $( \\Delta p _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } )$ is given as: \n\nKnowing that $x _ { 2 } = 1 - x _ { 1 }$ , equation (1.23) reduces to \n\nIn a solution containing several non-volatile solutes, the lowering of the vapour pressure depends on the sum of the mole fraction of different solutes. \n\nEquation (1.24) can be written as \n\nThe expression on the left hand side of the equation as mentioned earlier is called relative lowering of vapour pressure and is equal to the mole fraction of the solute. The above equation can be written as: \n\nHere $n _ { 1 }$ and $n _ { 2 }$ are the number of moles of solvent and solute respectively present in the solution. For dilute solutions $n _ { 2 } < < n _ { 1 }$ , hence neglecting $n _ { 2 }$ in the denominator we have \n\nHere $w _ { 1 }$ and $w _ { 2 }$ are the masses and $M _ { 1 }$ and $M _ { 2 }$ are the molar masses of the solvent and solute respectively. \n\nFrom this equation (1.28), knowing all other quantities, the molar mass of solute $( M _ { 2 } )$ can be calculated. \n\nExample 1.6 \n\nThe vapour pressure of pure benzene at a certain temperature is 0.850 bar. A non-volatile, non-electrolyte solid weighing $0 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ when added to $3 9 . 0 \\mathrm { g }$ of benzene (molar mass $7 8 \\mathrm { g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ . Vapour pressure of the solution, then, is 0.845 bar. What is the molar mass of the solid substance? \n\nSolution The various quantities known to us are as follows: ${ p _ { 1 } } ^ { 0 } \\mathrm { ~ = ~ } 0 . 8 5 0$ bar; $ { p } = 0 . 8 4 5$ bar; $M _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } = 7 8 \\mathrm { g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { \\mathrm { - 1 } }$ ; $w _ { 2 } = 0 . 5 \\ : \\mathrm { g }$ i $w _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } = 3 9 \\ : \\mathrm { g }$ (cid:) Substituting these values in equation (2.28), we get \n\nTherefore, $M _ { 2 } = 1 7 0 \\mathrm { g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ \n\n1.6.2 Elevation of Boiling Point \n\nThe vapour pressure of a liquid increases with increase of temperature. It boils at the temperature at which its vapour pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at 373.15 K $\\mathrm { ( 1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } C ) }$ because at this temperature the vapour pressure of water is 1.013 bar (1 atmosphere). We have also learnt in the last section that vapour pressure of the solvent decreases in the presence of non-volatile solute. Fig. 1.7 depicts the variation of vapour pressure of the pure solvent and solution as a function of temperature. For example, the vapour pressure of an aqueous solution of sucrose is less than 1.013 bar at 373.15 K. In order to make this solution boil, its vapour pressure must be increased to 1.013 bar by raising the temperature above the boiling temperature of the pure solvent (water). Thus, the boiling point of a solution is always higher than that of the boiling point of the pure solvent in which the solution is prepared as shown in Fig. 1.7. Similar to lowering of vapour pressure, the elevation of boiling point also depends on the number of solute molecules rather than their nature. A solution of $1 \\ m 0 1$ of sucrose in $1 0 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of water boils at $3 7 3 . 5 2 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ at one atmospheric pressure. \n\nLet $T _ { \\mathrm { b } } ^ { 0 }$ be the boiling point of pure solvent and $T _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ be the boiling point of solution. The increase in the boiling point $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } } = T _ { \\mathrm { b } } - T _ { \\mathrm { b } } ^ { 0 }$ is known as elevation of boiling point. \n\nExperiments have shown that for dilute solutions the elevation of boiling point $( \\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } } )$ is directly proportional to the molal concentration of the solute in a solution. Thus \n\nHere $m$ (molality) is the number of moles of solute dissolved in $1 ~ \\mathrm { k g }$ of solvent and the constant of proportionality, $K _ { \\mathrm { { b } } }$ is called Boiling Point Elevation Constant or Molal Elevation Constant (Ebullioscopic Constant). The unit of $K _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ is $\\mathrm { K } \\mathrm { k g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ . Values of $K _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ for some common solvents are given in Table 1.3. If $\\mathbf { w } _ { 2 }$ gram of solute of molar mass $M _ { 2 }$ is dissolved in $\\mathbf { w } _ { 1 }$ gram of solvent, then molality, m of the solution is given by the expression: \n\nSubstituting the value of molality in equation (1.30) we get \n\nThus, in order to determine $M _ { 2 }$ , molar mass of the solute, known mass of solute in a known mass of the solvent is taken and $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ is determined experimentally for a known solvent whose $K _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ value is known. \n\n$1 8 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ of glucose, $\\mathrm { C _ { 6 } H _ { 1 2 } O _ { 6 } }$ , is dissolved in $1 ~ \\mathrm { k g }$ of water in a saucepan. At what temperature will water boil at 1.013 bar? $K _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ for water is 0.52 $\\mathrm { ~ K ~ k g ~ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ . \n\nExample 1.7 \n\nMoles of glucose $= 1 8 \\mathrm { \\ g / \\ 1 8 0 \\ g \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } = 0 . 1 \\ m o l }$ Number of kilograms of solvent $= 1 ~ \\mathrm { k g }$ Thus molality of glucose solution $= 0 . 1 \\mathrm { \\ m o l \\ k g ^ { - 1 } }$ For water, change in boiling point \n\n$\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } } = K _ { \\mathrm { b } } \\times m = 0 . 5 2 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ k g ~ m o l ^ { - 1 } ~ } \\times \\ : 0 . 1 \\mathrm { ~ m o l ~ k g ^ { - 1 } = 0 . 0 5 2 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ } }$ Since water boils at 373.15 K at 1.013 bar pressure, therefore, the boiling point of solution will be $3 7 3 . 1 5 + 0 . 0 5 2 = 3 7 3 . 2 0 2 \\mathrm { ~ K } .$ (id:) \n\nExample 1.8 \n\nThe boiling point of benzene is 353.23 K. When $1 . 8 0 \\ : \\mathrm { g }$ of a non-volatile solute was dissolved in $9 0 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ of benzene, the boiling point is raised to 354.11 K. Calculate the molar mass of the solute. $K _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ for benzene is 2.53 $\\mathrm { K } \\mathrm { k g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ (cid:) \n\nSolution \n\nThe elevation $( \\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } } )$ in the boiling point $= 3 5 4 . 1 1 \\mathrm { K } - 3 5 3 . 2 3 \\mathrm { K } = 0 . 8 8 \\mathrm { K }$ Substituting these values in expression (2.33) we get \n\nTherefore, molar mass of the solute, $M _ { 2 } = 5 8 \\mathrm { g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ \n\n1.6.3 Depression of Freezing Point \n\nThe lowering of vapour pressure of a solution causes a lowering of the freezing point compared to that of the pure solvent (Fig. 1.8). We know that at the freezing point of a substance, the solid phase is in dynamic equilibrium with the liquid phase. Thus, the freezing point of a substance may be defined as the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the substance in its liquid phase is equal to its vapour pressure in the solid phase. A solution will freeze when its vapour pressure equals the vapour pressure of the pure solid solvent as is clear from Fig. 1.8. According to Raoult's law, when a non-volatile solid is added to the solvent its vapour pressure decreases and now it would become equal to that of solid solvent at lower temperature. Thus, the freezing point of the solvent decreases. \n\nLet $T _ { \\mathrm { f } } ^ { 0 }$ be the freezing point of pure solvent and $T _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ be its freezing point when non-volatile solute is dissolved in it. The decrease in freezing point. \n\n$\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } } = T _ { \\mathrm { f } } ^ { 0 } - T _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ is known as depression in freezing point. \n\nSimilar to elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point $( \\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } } )$ for dilute solution (ideal solution) is directly proportional to molality, m of the solution. Thus, \n\nor \n\nThe proportionality constant, $\\mathrm { K } _ { \\mathrm { f } } ,$ which depends on the nature of the solvent is known as Freezing Point Depression Constant or Molal \n\nDepression Constant or Cryoscopic Constant. The unit of $\\mathrm { K _ { f } }$ is $\\textrm { K k g }$ $\\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ . Values of $K _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ for some common solvents are listed in Table 1.3. \n\nIf $\\mathbf { w } _ { 2 }$ gram of the solute having molar mass as $M _ { 2 }$ , present in $\\mathbf { w } _ { 1 }$ gram of solvent, produces the depression in freezing point $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ of the solvent then molality of the solute is given by the equation (1.31). \n\nSubstituting this value of molality in equation (1.34) we get: \n\nThus for determining the molar mass of the solute we should know the quantities $\\mathbf { W } _ { 1 } , \\mathbf { W } _ { 2 } , \\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } } ,$ along with the molal freezing point depression constant. \n\nThe values of $K _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ and $K _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ which depend upon the nature of the solvent, can be ascertained from the following relations. \n\nHere the symbols $R$ and $M _ { 1 }$ stand for the gas constant and molar mass of the solvent, respectively and $T _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ and $T _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ denote the freezing point and the boiling point of the pure solvent respectively in kelvin. Further, $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { f u s } } H$ and $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { v a p } } H$ represent the enthalpies for the fusion and vapourisation of the solvent, respectively. \n\nExample 1.9 \n\nSolution \n\n$4 5 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of ethylene glycol $\\mathrm { ( C _ { 2 } H _ { 6 } O _ { 2 } ) }$ is mixed with $6 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of water. Calculate (a) the freezing point depression and (b) the freezing point of the solution. Depression in freezing point is related to the molality, therefore, the molality moles of ethylene glycol of the solution with respect to ethylene glyol $=$ mass of water in kilogram $\\mathrm { M o l e s \\ o f \\ e t h y l e n e \\ g l y c o l = { \\frac { 4 5 \\ g } { 6 2 \\ g \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } } } = 0 . 7 3 \\ m o l }$   \nMass of water in kg = 1000g kg-1 $\\mathrm { k g = \\frac { 6 0 0 g } { 1 0 0 0 g \\ k g ^ { - 1 } } = 0 . 6 \\ k g }$   \n${ \\mathrm { H e n c e ~ m o l a l i t y ~ o f ~ e t h y l e n e ~ g l y c o l } } = { \\frac { 0 . 7 3 ~ { \\mathrm { m o l } } } { 0 . 6 0 ~ { \\mathrm { k g } } } } = 1 . 2 ~ { \\mathrm { m o l } } ~ { \\mathrm { k g ^ { - 1 } } }$   \nTherefore freezing point depression, ed $\\ddot { \\mathrm { A } } T _ { \\mathrm { f } } = 1 . 8 6 \\mathrm { ~ K } \\mathrm { k g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 } \\times 1 . 2 \\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 } = 2 . 2 \\mathrm { K }$   \nFreezing point of the aqueous solution $= 2 7 3 . 1 5 \\mathrm { K } - 2 . 2 \\mathrm { K } = 2 7 0 . 9 5 \\mathrm { K }$ \n\nExample 1.10 \n\n$1 . 0 0 \\mathrm { g }$ of a non-electrolyte solute dissolved in $5 0 \\mathrm { g }$ of benzene lowered the freezing point of benzene by O.40 K. The freezing point depression constant of benzene is $5 . 1 2 \\mathrm { K } \\mathrm { k g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ Find the molar mass of the solute. \n\nSolution \n\nSubstituting the values of various terms involved in equation (1.36) we get, \n\n1.6.4 0smosis and Osmotic Pressure \n\nThere are many phenomena which we observe in nature or at home. For example, raw mangoes shrivel when pickled in brine (salt water); wilted flowers revive when placed in fresh water, blood cells collapse when suspended in saline water, etc. If we look into these processes we \n\nfind one thing common in all, that is, all these substances are bound by membranes. These membranes can be of animal or vegetable origin and these occur naturally such as pig's bladder or parchment or can be synthetic such as cellophane. These membranes appear to be continuous sheets or films, yet they contain a network of submicroscopic holes or pores. Small solvent \n\nmolecules, like water, can pass through these holes but the passage of bigger molecules like solute is hindered. Membranes having this kind of properties are known as semipermeable membranes (SPM). \n\nAssume that only solvent molecules can pass through these semipermeable membranes. If this membrane is placed between the solvent and solution as shown in Fig. 1.9, the solvent molecules will flow through the membrane from pure solvent to the solution. This process of flow of the solvent is called osmosis. \n\nThe flow will continue till the equilibrium is attained. The flow of the solvent from its side to solution side across a semipermeable membrane can be stopped if some extra pressure is applied on the solution. This pressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called osmotic pressure of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to the concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to osmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules always flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution. The osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration of the solution. \n\nThe osmotic pressure of a solution is the excess pressure that must be applied to a solution to prevent osmosis, i.e., to stop the passage of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane into the solution. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.10. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property as it depends on the number of solute molecules and not on their identity. For dilute solutions, it has been found experimentally that osmotic pressure is proportional to the molarity, $\\pmb { c }$ of the solution at a given temperature $\\pmb { T }$ Thus: \n\nHere $\\Pi$ is the osmotic pressure and $\\mathrm { R }$ is the gas constant. \n\nHere $V$ is volume of a solution in litres containing $\\mathbf { n } _ { 2 }$ moles of solute. If $\\mathbf { w } _ { 2 }$ grams of solute, of molar mass, $M _ { 2 }$ is present in the solution, then $n _ { 2 } = \\mathrm { w } _ { 2 } \\ / \\ M _ { 2 }$ and we can write, \n\nThus, knowing the quantities $\\mathbf { w } _ { 2 }$ , $T , \\Pi$ and $V$ we can calculate the molar mass of the solute. \n\nMeasurement of osmotic pressure provides another method of determining molar masses of solutes. This method is widely used to determine molar masses of proteins, polymers and other macromolecules. The osmotic pressure method has the advantage over other methods as pressure measurement is around the room temperature and the molarity of the solution is used instead of molality. As compared to other colligative properties, its magnitude is large even for very dilute solutions. The technique of osmotic pressure for determination of molar mass of solutes is particularly useful for biomolecules as they are generally not stable at higher temperatures and polymers have poor solubility. \n\nTwo solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given temperature are called isotonic solutions. When such solutions are separated by semipermeable membrane no osmosis occurs between them. For example, the osmotic pressure associated with the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/volume) sodium chloride solution, called normal saline solution and it is safe to inject intravenously. On the other hand, if we place the cells in a solution containing more than $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/ volume) sodium chloride, water will flow out of the cells and they would shrink. Such a solution is called hypertonic. If the salt concentration is less than $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/volume), the solution is said to be hypotonic. In this case, water will flow into the cells if placed in this solution and they would swell. • \n\nExample 1.11 \n\n$2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m ^ { 3 } }$ of an aqueous solution of a protein contains $1 . 2 6 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of the protein. The osmotic pressure of such a solution at $3 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { K }$ is found to be $2 . 5 7 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ bar. Calculate the molar mass of the protein. \n\nSolution \n\nThe various quantities known to us are as follows: $\\Pi = 2 . 5 7 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ bar, \n\nSubstituting these values in equation (2.42) we get \n\nThe phenomena mentioned in the beginning of this section can be explained on the basis of osmosis. A raw mango placed in concentrated salt solution loses water via osmosis and shrivel into pickle. Wilted flowers revive when placed in fresh water. A carrot that has become limp because of water loss into the atmosphere can be placed into the water making it firm once again. Water will move into its cells through osmosis. When placed in water containing less than $0 . 9 \\%$ (mass/ volume) salt, blood cells swell due to flow of water in them by osmosis. People taking a lot of salt or salty food experience water retention in tissue cells and intercellular spaces because of osmosis. The resulting puffiness or swelling is called edema. Water movement from soil into plant roots and subsequently into upper portion of the plant is partly due to osmosis. The preservation of meat by salting and of fruits by adding sugar protects against bacterial action. Through the process of osmosis, a bacterium on salted meat or candid fruit loses water, shrivels and dies. \n\n1.6.5 Reverse Osmosis and water Purification \n\nThe direction of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure larger than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution side. That is, now the pure solvent flows out of the solution through the semi permeable membrane. This phenomenon is called reverse osmosis and is of great practical utility. Reverse osmosis is used in desalination of sea water. A schematic set up for the process is shown in Fig. 1.11. \n\nWhen pressure more than osmotic pressure is applied, pure water is squeezed out of the sea water through the membrane. A variety of polymer membranes are available for this purpose. \n\nThe pressure required for the reverse osmosis is quite high. A workable porous membrane is a film of cellulose acetate placed over a suitable support. Cellulose acetate is permeable to water but impermeable to impurities and ions present in sea water. These days many countries use desalination plants to meet their potable water requirements. \n\nIntext Questions \n\n1.9 Vapour pressure of pure water at $2 9 8 \\ \\mathrm { K }$ is $2 3 . 8 ~ \\mathrm { m m ~ H g . ~ 5 0 ~ g }$ of urea (cid:) $\\mathrm { ( N H _ { 2 } C O N H _ { 2 } ) }$ is dissolved in $8 5 0 \\mathrm { g }$ of water.

For example, if we dissolve one mole of KCl $( 7 4 . 5 \\mathrm { g } )$ in water, we expect one mole each of $\\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ and $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ ions to be released in the solution. If this happens, there would be two moles of particles in the solution. If we ignore interionic attractions, one mole of KCl in one $\\mathbf { k } \\mathbf { g }$ of water would be expected to increase the boiling point by $2 \\times 0 . 5 2 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ } = \\mathrm { ~ 1 . 0 4 ~ K ~ }$ Now if we did not know about the degree of dissociation, we could be led to conclude that the mass of $2 \\mathrm { m o l }$ particles is $7 4 . 5 \\textrm { g }$ and the mass of one mole of KCl would be $\\mathrm { 3 7 . 2 5 ~ g } .$ This brings into light the rule that, when there is dissociation of solute into ions, the experimentally determined molar mass is always lower than the true value. \n\n2 $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { C O O H }  ( \\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { C O O H } ) _ { 2 }$ H₃C-C OH-0 O-H0 C−CH \n\nMolecules of ethanoic acid (acetic acid) dimerise in benzene due to hydrogen bonding.

The molar mass calculated on the basis of this $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { b } }$ or $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ will, therefore, be twice the expected value. Such a molar mass that is either lower or higher than the expected or normal value is called as abnormal molar mass. \n\nIn l880 van't Hoff introduced a factor i, known as the van't Hoff factor, to account for the extent of dissociation or association. This factor i is defined as: - \n\nNormal molar mass Abnormal molar mass blis Observed colligative property Calculated colligative property i Total number of moles of particles after association/dissociation Number of moles of particles before association/dissociation \n\nHere abnormal molar mass is the experimentally determined molar mass and calculated colligative properties are obtained by assuming that the non-volatile solute is neither associated nor dissociated. In case of association, value of i is less than unity while for dissociation it is greater than unity. For example, the value of i for aqueous KCl solution is close to 2, while the value for ethanoic acid in benzene is nearly 0.5. \n\nInclusion of van't Hoff factor modifies the equations for colligative properties as follows: \n\nRelative lowering of vapour pressure of solvent, \n\nElevation of Boiling point, $\\Delta T _ { b } ^ { \\mathrm { ~ = ~ } i \\mathrm { ~ } K _ { b } }$ m Depression of Freezing point, $\\Delta T _ { f } = \\ i \\ K _ { f } \\ \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ Osmotic pressure of solution, $\\Pi \\ = \\ i \\ n _ { 2 } \\ R \\ T \\ / \\ V$ \n\nTable 1.4 depicts values of the factor, i for several strong electrolytes. For KCl, NaCl and $\\mathrm { M g S O _ { 4 } }$ , i values approach 2 as the solution becomes very dilute. As expected, the value of $_ i$ gets close to 3 for $\\mathrm { { K _ { 2 } S O _ { 4 } } }$ \n\nExample 1.12 \n\n$_ { 2 \\mathrm { ~ g ~ } }$ of benzoic acid $\\mathrm { ( C _ { 6 } H _ { 5 } C O O H ) }$ dissolved in $2 5 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of benzene shows a depression in freezing point equal to $1 . 6 2 \\mathrm { K }$ . Molal depression constant for benzene is $4 . 9 \\mathrm { K } \\mathrm { k g } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ . What is the percentage association of acid if it forms dimer in solution? \n\nThe given quantities are: $\\mathrm { w } _ { 2 } = 2 \\ : \\mathrm { g } ; \\ : K _ { \\mathrm { f } } = 4 . 9 \\ : \\mathrm { K } \\ : \\mathrm { k g } \\ : \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ ; $\\mathbf { w } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } = 2 5 \\ : \\mathrm { g }$ \n\nSolution \n\nSubstituting these values in equation (1.36) we get: \n\nThus, experimental molar mass of benzoic acid in benzene is $= 2 4 1 . 9 8 \\ \\mathrm { g \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ (cid \n\nNow consider the following equilibrium for the acid: \n\nIf $x$ represents the degree of association of the solute then we would have $\\left( 1 ~ - ~ x \\right)$ mol of benzoic acid left in unassociated form and correspondingly $\\frac x 2$ as associated moles of benzoic acid at equilibrium. Therefore, total number of moles of particles at equilibrium is: \n\nThus, total number of moles of particles at equilibrium equals van't Hoff factor i. \n\nTherefore, degree of association of benzoic acid in benzene is $9 9 . 2 \\%$ \n\nExample 1.13 \n\n$0 . 6 ~ \\mathrm { m L }$ of acetic acid $\\mathrm { \\small { ( C H _ { 3 } C O O H ) } }$ , having density $1 . 0 6 \\ \\mathrm { g \\ m L ^ { - 1 } }$ , is dissolved in 1 litre of water. The depression in freezing point observed for this strength of acid was $0 . 0 2 0 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . Calculate the van't Hoff factor and the dissociation constant of acid. \n\nSolution Number of moles of acetic acid 0.6 mL × 1.06 g mL-1 60 g mo1-1 $\\mathrm { M o l a l i t y } = { \\frac { 0 . 0 1 0 6 { \\ m o l } } { 1 0 0 0 { \\ m L } \\times 1 \\ \\mathrm { g \\ m L } ^ { - 1 } } } = 0 . 0 1 0 6 \\ \\mathrm { m o l \\ k g ^ { - 1 } }$ $= 0 . 0 1 0 6 ~ \\mathrm { m o l } = n$ sned Using equation (1.35) $\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { f } } = 1 . 8 6 \\mathrm { K } \\mathrm { k g } \\mathrm { m o l ^ { - 1 } } \\times 0 . 0 1 0 6 \\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { k g ^ { - 1 } } = 0 . 0 1 9 7 \\mathrm { K }$ var $\\mathrm { ` t ~ H o f f F a c t o r } \\left( \\vartheta = \\frac { \\mathrm { O b s e r v e d ~ f r e e z i n g ~ p o i n t } } { \\mathrm { C a l c u l a t e d ~ f r e e z i n g ~ p o i n t } } = \\frac { 0 . 0 2 0 5 ~ \\mathrm { ~ K } } { 0 . 0 1 9 7 ~ \\mathrm { K } } = 1 . 0 4 1 \\right.$ Acetic acid is a weak electrolyte and will dissociate into two ions: acetate and hydrogen ions per molecule of acetic acid. If $x$ is the degree of dissociation of acetic acid, then we would have n $( 1 - x )$ moles of undissociated acetic acid, nx moles of $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C O O ^ { - } }$ and $n x$ moles of $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ ions, \n\nThus total moles of particles are: $n ( 1 - x + x + x ) = n ( 1 + x )$ \n\nThus degree of dissociation of acetic acid $= x = 1 . 0 4 1 - 1 . 0 0 0 = 0 . 0 4 1$ \n\nA solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. Solutions are classified as solid, liquid and gaseous solutions. The concentration of a solution is expressed in terms of mole fraction, molarity, molality and in percentages. The dissolution of a gas in a liquid is governed by Henry's law, according to which, at a given temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas. The vapour pressure of the solvent is lowered by the presence of a non-volatile solute in the solution and this lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent is governed by Raoult's law, according to which the relative lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent over a solution is equal to the mole fraction of a non-volatile solute present in the solution. However, in a binary liquid solution, if both the components of the solution are volatile then another form of Raoult's law is used. Mathematically, this form of the Raoult's law is stated as: $p _ { \\mathrm { t o t a l } } = p _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } ^ { \\mathrm { 0 } } x _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } + p _ { \\mathrm { 2 } } ^ { \\mathrm { 0 } } x _ { \\mathrm { 2 } }$ . Solutions which obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration are called ideal solutions. Two types of deviations from Raoult's law, called positive and negative deviations are observed. Azeotropes arise due to very large deviations from Raoult's law. \n\nThe properties of solutions which depend on the number of solute particles and are independent of their chemical identity are called colligative properties. These are lowering of vapour pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point and osmotic pressure. The process of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure higher than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution. Colligative properties have been used to determine the molar mass of solutes. Solutes which dissociate in solution exhibit molar mass lower than the actual molar mass and those which associate show higher molar mass than their actual values. \n\nQuantitatively, the extent to which a solute is dissociated or associated can be expressed by van't Hoff factor i. This factor has been defined as ratio of normal molar mass to experimentally determined molar mass or as the ratio of observed colligative property to the calculated colligative property. \n\n1.1 Define the term solution.

    "content": "Objectives \n\nAfter studying this Unit, you will be able to \n\n● describe an electrochemical cell and differentiate between galvanic and electrolytic cells; apply Nernst equation for calculating the emf of galvanic cell and define standard potential of the cell;   \n• derive relation between standard potential of the cell, Gibbs energy of cell reaction and its equilibrium constant; define resistivity (p), conductivity (k) and molar conductivity $\\left( \\boldsymbol { \\Lambda } _ { \\boldsymbol { m } } \\right)$ of ionic solutions; differentiate between ionic (electrolytic) and electronic conductivity; describe the method for measurement of conductivity of electrolytic solutions and calculation of their molar conductivity; justify the variation of conductivity and molar conductivity of solutions with change in their concentration and define $A _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ (molar conductivity at zero concentration or infinite dilution); enunciate Kohlrausch law and learn its applications; understand quantitative aspects of electrolysis; describe the construction of some primary and secondary batteries and fuel cells; explain corrosion as an elertrochemical nrocess \n\nChemical reactions can be used to produce electrical energy, conversely, electrical energy can be used to carry out chemical reactions that do not proceed spontaneously. \n\nElectrochemistry is the study of production of electricity from energy released during spontaneous chemical reactions and the use of electrical energy to bring about non-spontaneous chemical transformations. The subject is of importance both for theoretical and practical considerations. A large number of metals, sodium hydroxide, chlorine, fluorine and many other chemicals are produced by electrochemical methods. Batteries and fuel cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy and are used on a large scale in various instruments and devices. The reactions carried out electrochemically can be energy efficient and less polluting. Therefore, study of electrochemistry is important for creating new technologies that are ecofriendly. The transmission of sensory signals through cells to brain and vice versa and communication between the cells are known to have electrochemical origin. Electrochemistry, is therefore, a very vast and interdisciplinary subject. In this Unit, we will cover only some of its important elementary aspects. \n\nWe had studied the construction and functioning of Daniell cell (Fig. 2.1). This cell converts the chemical energy liberated during the redox reaction \n\nElectron flow \n\nto electrical energy and has an electrical potential equal to $1 . 1 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ when concentration of $Z \\mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ and $\\mathrm { \\Delta C u ^ { 2 + } }$ ions is unity $( 1 ~ \\mathrm { m o l } ~ \\mathrm { d m } ^ { - 3 } ) ^ { * }$ Such a device is called a galvanic or a voltaic cell. \n\nIf an external opposite potential is applied in the galvanic cell [Fig. 2.2(a)] and increased slowly, we find that the reaction continues to take place till the opposing voltage reaches the value $1 . 1 \\mathrm { V }$ [Fig. 2.2(b)] when, the reaction stops altogether and no current flows through the cell. Any further increase in the external potential again starts the reaction but in the opposite direction [Fig. 2.2(c)]. It now functions as an electrolytic cell, a device for using electrical energy to carry non-spontaneous chemical reactions. Both types of cells are quite important and we shall study some of their salient features in the following pages. \n\nWhen $\\mathrm { E } _ { \\mathrm { e x t } } = 1 . 1 ~ \\mathrm { V }$ (i) No flow of electrons or current.   \n(ii No chemical reaction. \n\nWhen $\\mathrm { E } _ { \\mathrm { e x t } } < 1 . 1$ V (i) Electrons flow from Zn rod to Cu rod hence current flows from Cu to Zn. (ii) $Z \\mathrm { n }$ dissolves at anode and copper deposits at cathode. \n\nAs mentioned earlier a galvanic cell is an electrochemical cell that converts the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction into electrical energy. In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for running a motor or other electrical gadgets like heater, fan, geyser, etc. \n\nDaniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following redox reaction occurs. \n\nThis reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition gives the overall cell reaction: \n\nThese reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell. The reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the oxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions of the cell are also called half-cells or redox couples. The copper electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode, the oxidation half-cell. \n\nWe can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each halfcell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two half-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1. Sometimes, both the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we do not require a salt bridge. \n\nAt each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make it positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode have a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the electrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At equilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively or negatively charged with respect to the solution. A potential difference develops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called electrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved in a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard electrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other half-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a positive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a potential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the switch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of electron flow. \n\nThe potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic cell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell potential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive force (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and the cathode on the right while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal and electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the halfcell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the left hand side i.e., \n\nThis is illustrated by the following example: \n\nCell reaction: \n\nHalf-cell reactions: \n\nIt can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction (2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as: \n\nThe potential of individual half-cell cannot be measured. We can measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one electrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect to this. According to convention, a half-cell called standard hydrogen electrode (Fig.3.3) represented by $\\mathrm { P t ( \\bar { s } ) } \\mid \\mathrm { H _ { 2 } ( g ) } \\mid \\mathrm { H ^ { + } ( a q ) }$ , is assigned a zero potential at all temperatures corresponding to the reaction \n\nThe standard hydrogen electrode consists of a platinum electrode coated with platinum black. The electrode is dipped in an acidic solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled through it. The concentration of both the reduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is maintained at unity (Fig. 2.3). This implies that the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar and the concentration of hydrogen ion in the solution is one molar. \n\nAt 298 K the emf of the cell, standard hydrogen electrode Il second half-cell constructed by taking standard hydrogen electrode as anode (reference half-cell) and the other half-cell as cathode, gives the reduction potential of the other half-cell. If the concentrations of the oxidised and the reduced forms of the species in the right hand half-cell are unity, then the cell potential is equal to standard electrode potential, $E _ { \\mathrm { ~ \\tiny ~ R ~ } } ^ { \\mathrm { 0 } }$ of the given half-cell. \n\nAs $\\boldsymbol { E } _ { \\mathrm { ~ L ~ } } ^ { 0 }$ for standard hydrogen electrode is zero. \n\nThe measured emf of the cell: \n\n$\\mathrm { P t ( s ) } \\mid \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } ( \\mathrm { g } , \\mathrm { ~ 1 ~ b a r } ) \\mid \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } ( \\mathrm { a q } , \\mathrm { ~ 1 ~ M } ) \\mid \\mid \\mathrm { C u } ^ { 2 + }$ (aq, 1 M) | Cu \n\nis $0 . 3 4 \\mathrm { V }$ and it is also the value for the standard electrode potential of the half-cell corresponding to the reaction: \n\nSimilarly, the measured emf of the cell: \n\n$\\mathrm { { P t ( s ) } \\mid \\ H _ { 2 } ( g , \\ l \\ b a r ) \\mid \\ H ^ { + } ( a q , \\ l \\ M ) \\mid \\mid \\ Z n ^ { 2 + } }$ (aq, 1M) |Zn \n\nis $- 0 . 7 6 \\mathrm { V }$ corresponding to the standard electrode potential of the half-cell reaction: 1 \n\nThe positive value of the standard electrode potential in the first case indicates that $\\mathrm { { C u } ^ { 2 + } }$ ions get reduced more easily than $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ ions. The reverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu (or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion) under the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not dissolve in HCl. In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by hydrogen ion. The negative value of the standard electrode potential in the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or zinc can reduce hydrogen ions). \n\nIn view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in Fig. 2.1 can be written as: \n\nLeft electrode: $\\mathrm { Z n } ( \\mathrm { s } )  \\mathrm { Z n } ^ { 2 + }$ (aq, $\\mathrm { ~ 1 ~ M ~ 1 ~ 2 ~ e ~ } ^ { - }$ \n\nRight electrode: ${ \\mathrm { C u } } ^ { 2 + }$ (aq, $1 \\ \\mathrm { M } ) + 2 \\ \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }  \\mathrm { C u ( s ) }$ \n\nThe overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions and we obtain the equation: \n\nSometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes. They do not participate in the reaction but provide their surface for oxidation or reduction reactions and for the conduction of electrons. For example, $\\mathrm { P t }$ is used in the following half-cells: \n\nHydrogen electrode: $\\mathrm { P t } ( \\mathrm { s } ) \\mid \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } ( \\mathrm { g } ) \\mid \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } ( \\mathrm { a q } )$ \n\nwith half-cell reaction: $\\mathrm { H ^ { + } ( a q ) + e ^ { - }  \\Omega ^ { \\downarrow } 2 \\ H _ { 2 } ( g ) }$ \n\nBromine electrode: $\\mathrm { P t ( s ) } | \\mathrm { B r } _ { 2 } ( \\mathrm { a q } ) | \\ \\mathrm { B r } ^ { - } ( \\mathrm { a q } )$ \n\nWith half-cell reaction: $\\mathrm { \\Omega ^ { 1 } / 2 \\ B r _ { 2 } ( a q ) + e ^ { - }  B r ^ { - } ( a q ) }$ \n\nThe standard electrode potentials are very important and we can extract a lot of useful information from them. The values of standard electrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are given in Table 2.1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode is greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to hydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative then hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species. It can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the highest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas $( \\mathrm { F _ { 2 } } )$ has the maximum tendency to get reduced to fluoride ions $( \\mathrm { F ^ { - } } )$ and therefore fluorine gas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest reducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating that lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is the most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be seen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2.1 the standard electrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising power of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of the species on the right hand side of the reaction. Electrochemical cells are extensively used for determining the pH of solutions, solubility product, equilibrium constant and other thermodynamic properties and for potentiometric titrations. - \n\nIntext Questions \n\n2.1 How would you determine the standard electrode potential of the system $\\mathbf { M g } ^ { 2 + } | \\mathbf { M g } ?$ (cid:) \n\n2.2 Can you store copper sulphate solutions in a zinc pot? \n\n2.3 Consult the table of standard electrode potentials and suggest three substances that can oxidise ferrous ions under suitable conditions. \n\n2.3 Nernst Equation \n\nwe have assumed in the previous section that the concentration of all the species involved in the electrode reaction is unity.

At the same time voltage of the cell as read on the voltmeter keeps on decreasing. After some time, we shall note that there is no change in the concentration of $\\mathrm { C u ^ { 2 + } }$ and $Z \\mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ ions and at the same time, voltmeter gives zero reading. This indicates that equilibrium has been attained. In this situation the Nernst equation may be written as: \n\nBut at equilibrium, \n\nand at $\\mathrm { T } = 2 9 8 \\mathrm { K }$ the above equation can be written as \n\nIn general, \n\nThus, Eq. (2.14) gives a relationship between equilibrium constant of the reaction and standard potential of the cell in which that reaction takes place.

If we want to obtain maximum work from a galvanic cell then charge has to be passed reversibly. The reversible work done by a galvanic cell is equal to decrease in its Gibbs energy and therefore, if the emf of the cell is $E$ and $n F$ is the amount of charge passed and $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { r } } G$ is the Gibbs energy of the reaction, then \n\nIt may be remembered that $E _ { \\mathrm { ( c e l l ) } }$ is an intensive parameter but $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { r } } G$ is an extensive thermodynamic property and the value depends on $n$ Thus, if we write the reaction - \n\nbut when we write the reaction \n\nIf the concentration of all the reacting species is unity, then (id \n\nThus, from the measurement of $E _ { \\mathrm { ( c e l l ) } } ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ we can obtain an important thermodynamic quantity, $\\Delta _ { \\mathrm { r } } G ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ , standard Gibbs energy of the reaction.

Calculate the standard Gibbs energy and the equilibrium constant of the cell reaction. \n\nIt is necessary to define a few terms before we consider the subject of conductance of electricity through electrolytic solutions. The electrical resistance is represented by the symbol $\\mathbf { \\vec { \\nabla } } R \\mathbf { \\vec { \\mu } }$ and it is measured in ohm $\\left( \\Omega \\right)$ which in terms of SI base units is equal to $( \\mathrm { k g \\ m ^ { 2 } } ) / ( \\mathrm { S } ^ { 3 } \\ A ^ { 2 } )$ . It can be measured with the help of a wheatstone bridge with which you are familiar from your study of physics. The electrical resistance of any object is directly proportional to its length, l, and inversely proportional to its area of cross section, $A .$ That is, \n\nThe constant of proportionality, p (Greek, rho), is called resistivity (specific resistance). Its SI units are ohm metre $\\left( \\Omega \\mathrm { ~ m } \\right)$ and quite often its submultiple, ohm centimetre $\\left( \\Omega \\mathrm { c m } \\right)$ is also used. IUPAC recommends the use of the term resistivity over specific resistance and hence in the rest of the book we shall use the term resistivity. Physically, the resistivity for a substance is its resistance when it is one metre long and its area of cross section is one $\\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ . It can be seen that: \n\nThe inverse of resistance, $R _ { : }$ is called conductance, $G$ , and we have the relation: \n\nThe SI unit of conductance is siemens, represented by the symbol $\\mathbf { \\ddot { S } } ^ { \\prime }$ and is equal to $\\mathrm { { o h m } ^ { - 1 } }$ (also known as mho) or $\\boldsymbol { \\Omega } ^ { - 1 }$ . The inverse of resistivity, called conductivity (specific conductance) is represented by the symbol, $\\kappa$ (Greek, kappa). IUPAC has recommended the use of term conductivity over specific conductance and hence we shall use the term conductivity in the rest of the book. The SI units of conductivity are $\\mathrm { ~ \\mathsf ~ { ~ S ~ m ~ } ~ } ^ { - 1 }$ but quite often, $\\kappa$ is expressed in $\\mathrm { ~ S ~ c m ^ { - 1 } }$ . Conductivity of a material in $\\mathrm { S ~ m ^ { - 1 } }$ is its conductance when it is $1 \\textrm { m }$ long and its area of cross section is $1 ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ . It may be noted that $1 ~ { \\mathrm { S } } ~ { \\mathrm { c m } } ^ { - 1 } = ~ 1 0 0 ~ { \\mathrm { S } } ~ { \\mathrm { m } } ^ { - 1 }$ \n\nIt can be seen from Table 2.2 that the magnitude of conductivity varies a great deal and depends on the nature of the material. It also depends on the temperature and pressure at which the measurements are made. Materials are classified into conductors, insulators and semiconductors depending on the magnitude of their conductivity. Metals and their alloys have very large conductivity and are known as conductors. Certain non-metals like carbon-black, graphite and some organic polymers\\* are also electronically conducting. Substances like glass, ceramics, etc., having very low conductivity are known as insulators. Substances like silicon, doped silicon and gallium arsenide having conductivity between conductors and insulators are called semiconductors and are important electronic materials. Certain materials called superconductors by definition have zero resistivity or infinite conductivity. Earlier, only metals and their alloys at very low temperatures (0 to 15 K) were known to behave as superconductors, but nowadays a number of ceramic materials and mixed oxides are also known to show superconductivity at temperatures as high as 150 K. \n\nElectrical conductance through metals is called metallic or electronic conductance and is due to the movement of electrons. The electronic conductance depends on \n\n(i) the nature and structure of the metal (ii) the number of valence electrons per atom (ii) temperature (it decreases with increase of temperature). \n\nAs the electrons enter at one end and go out through the other end, the composition of the metallic conductor remains unchanged. The mechanism of conductance through semiconductors is more complex. \n\nWe already know that even very pure water has small amounts of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions $( { \\sim } 1 0 ^ { - 7 } \\mathrm { M } )$ which lend it very low conductivity $( \\mathrm { { 3 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \\mathrm { { S m ^ { - 1 } } } } } )$ ). when electrolytes are dissolved in water, they furnish their own ions in the solution hence its conductivity also increases. The conductance of electricity by ions present in the solutions is called electrolytic or ionic conductance. The conductivity of electrolytic (ionic) solutions depends on: \n\n(i) the nature of the electrolyte added   \n(ii) size of the ions produced and their solvation   \n(ii) the nature of the solvent and its viscosity   \n(iv) concentration of the electrolyte (v) temperature (it increases with the increase of temperature). \n\nPassage of direct current through ionic solution over a prolonged period can lead to change in its composition due to electrochemical reactions (Section 2.4.1). \n\n2.4.1 Measurement of the Conductivity of Ionic Solutions \n\nWe know that accurate measurement of an unknown resistance can be performed on a Wheatstone bridge. However, for measuring the resistance of an ionic solution we face two problems. Firstly, passing direct current (DC) changes the composition of the solution. Secondly, a solution cannot be connected to the bridge like a metallic wire or other solid conductor. The first difficulty is resolved by using an alternating current (AC) source of power. The second problem is solved by using a specially designed vessel called conductivity cell. It is available in several designs and two simple ones are shown in Fig. 2.4. \n\nBasically it consists of two platinum electrodes coated with platinum black (finely divided metallic $\\mathrm { P t }$ is deposited on the electrodes electrochemically). These have area of cross section equal to $\\cdot _ { A } ,$ and are separated by distance $\\mathbf { \\nabla } ^ { \\cdot } l ^ { \\prime }$ . Therefore, solution confined between these electrodes is a column of length $l$ and area of cross section $A$ .The resistance of such a column of solution is then given by the equation: \n\nThe quantity $l / A$ is called cell constant denoted by the symbol, $G ^ { * }$ . It depends on the distance between the electrodes and their area of cross-section and has the dimension of length-' and can be calculated if we know I and A. Measurement of $l$ and $A$ is not only inconvenient but also unreliable. The cell constant is usually determined by measuring the resistance of the cell containing a solution whose conductivity is already known. For this purpose, we generally use KCl solutions whose conductivity is known accurately at various concentrations (Table 2.3) and at different temperatures. The cell constant, $G ^ { * }$ , is then given by the equation: \n\nOnce the cell constant is determined, we can use it for measuring the resistance or conductivity of any solution. The set up for the measurement of the resistance is shown in Fig. 2.5. \n\nIt consists of two resistances $R _ { 3 }$ and $R _ { 4 }$ ,a variable resistance $R _ { 1 }$ and the conductivity cell having the unknown resistance $R _ { 2 }$ .The wheatstone bridge is fed by an oscillator $\\mathrm { o }$ (a source of a.c. power in the audio frequency range 550 to 5000 cycles per second). $\\mathrm { P }$ is a suitable detector (a headphone or other electronic device) and the bridge is balanced when no current passes through the detector. Under these conditions: \n\nUnknown resistance $R _ { 2 } = \\frac { { \\sf R } _ { 1 } { \\sf R } _ { 4 } } { { \\sf R } _ { 3 } }$ \n\nThese days, inexpensive conductivity meters are available which can directly read the conductance or resistance of the solution in the conductivity cell. Once the cell constant and the resistance of the solution in the cell is determined, the conductivity of the solution is given by the equation: \n\nThe conductivity of solutions of different electrolytes in the same solvent and at a given temperature differs due to charge and size of the ions in which they dissociate, the concentration of ions or ease with which the ions move under a potential gradient. It, therefore, becomes necessary to define a physically more meaningful quantity called molar conductivity denoted by the symbol $\\varLambda _ { m }$ (Greek, lambda). It is related to the conductivity of the solution by the equation: \n\nIn the above equation, if $\\kappa$ is expressed in $\\mathbf { S } \\mathbf { m } ^ { - 1 }$ and the concentration, c in $\\mathrm { m o l } \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 3 }$ then the units of $\\varLambda _ { m }$ are in $\\mathrm { { S m ^ { 2 } m o l ^ { - 1 } } }$ . It may be noted that: \n\n$1 \\ \\mathrm { m o l \\ m ^ { - 3 } } = \\mathrm { 1 0 0 0 } ( \\mathrm { L } / \\mathrm { m ^ { 3 } } ) \\ \\times$ molarity (mol/L), and hence \n\nIf we use $\\mathrm { ~ S ~ c m ^ { - 1 } }$ as the units for $\\kappa$ and mol $\\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ , the units of concentration, then the units for $\\Lambda _ { m }$ are $\\mathrm { S \\ c m ^ { 2 } m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ . It can be calculated by using the equation: \n\nBoth type of units are used in literature and are related to each other by the equations: ■ \n\nResistance of a conductivity cell filled with $0 . 1 \\mathrm { \\ m o l { L } ^ { - 1 } }$ KCl solution is $1 0 0 ~ \\Omega$ .

Conductivity always decreases with decrease in concentration both, for weak and strong electrolytes. This can be explained by the fact that the number of ions per unit volume that carry the current in a solution decreases on dilution. The conductivity of a solution at any given concentration is the conductance of one unit volume of solution kept between two platinum electrodes with unit area of cross section and at a distance of unit length. This is clear from the equation: \n\n$G = \\frac { \\kappa A } { l } = \\kappa$ = k (both A and l are unity in their appropriate units in 1 or cm) \n\nMolar conductivity of a solution at a given concentration is the conductance of the volume $V$ of solution containing one mole of electrolyte kept between two electrodes with area of cross section $A$ and distance of unit length. Therefore, \n\nSince $l = 1$ and $A = V$ ( volume containing 1 mole of electrolyte) \n\nMolar conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. This is because the total volume, $V ,$ of solution containing one mole of electrolyte also increases. It has been found that decrease in $\\kappa$ on dilution of a solution is more than compensated by increase in its volume. Physically, it means that at a given concentration, $\\Lambda _ { m }$ can be defined as the conductance of the electrolytic solution kept between the electrodes of a conductivity cell at unit distance but having area of cross section large enough to accommodate sufficient volume of solution that contains one mole of the electrolyte. when concentration approaches zero, the molar conductivity is known as limiting molar conductivity and is represented by the symbol $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ .The variation in $\\varLambda _ { m }$ with concentration is different (Fig. 2.6) for strong and weak electrolytes. \n\nStrong Electrolytes \n\nFor strong electrolytes, $\\boldsymbol { { \\Lambda } } _ { m }$ increases slowly with dilution and can be represented by the equation: \n\nIt can be seen that if we plot (Fig. 2.6) $\\varLambda _ { m }$ against $c ^ { 1 / 2 }$ obtain  stight  withintercept eq $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ equal to $\\cdot _ { - A } ,$ . The value of the constant $\\cdot _ { A } \\cdot \\mathbf { \\vec { \\tau } }$ for a given solvent and temperature depends on the type of electrolyte i.e., the charges on the cation and anion produced on the dissociation of the electrolyte in the solution. Thus, NaCl, $\\mathrm { C a C l } _ { 2 }$ , $\\mathrm { M g S O _ { 4 } }$ are known as 1-1, 2-1 and 2-2 electrolytes respectively. All electrolytes of a particular type have the same value for $\\cdot _ { A } \\cdot \\mathbf { \\vec { \\tau } }$ . \n\nThe molar conductivity of KCl solutions at different concentrations at 298 K are given below: \n\nShow that a plot between $\\varLambda _ { m }$ and $c ^ { 1 / 2 }$ is a straight line. Determine the values of $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ and A for KCl. \n\nSolution Taking the square root of concentration we obtain: \n\nA plot of $\\varLambda _ { m }$ ( y-axis) and $\\mathbf { c } ^ { 1 / 2 }$ (cd $x$ axis) is shown in (Fig. 3.7).   \nIt can be seen that it is nearly a straight line. From the intercept   \n(cid: $\\lbrace c ^ { 1 / 2 } = 0 \\rbrace$ , we find that $\\mathring { \\Lambda _ { m } } = ~ 1 5 0 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { S ~ c m } ^ { 2 } ~ \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ and $A ~ = - ~ { \\mathrm { s l o p e } } ~ = 8 7 . 4 6 ~ { \\mathrm { S \\ c m ^ { 2 } \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } / ( m o l / L ^ { - 1 } ) ^ { 1 / 2 } } } .$ \n\nKohlrausch examined $\\hat { { \\cal { A } } } _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ values for a number of strong electrolytes and observed certain regularities. He noted that the difference in $\\bar { \\bar { \\varLambda _ { m } } }$ of the electrolytes NaX and KX for any $_ \\textrm { x }$ is nearly constant. For example at 298 K: \n\nand similarly it was found that \n\nOn the basis of the above observations he enunciated Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions. The law states that limiting molar conductivity of an electrolyte can be represented as the sum of the individual contributions of the anion and cation of the electrolyte. Thus, $i f \\lambda _ { N a } ^ { ^ { \\circ } } { } ^ { + } a n d \\lambda _ { c l } ^ { ^ { \\circ } } { } ^ { - }$ ions respectively, then the limiting molar conductivity for sodium chloride is given by the equation: \n\nIn general, if an electrolyte on dissociation gives $\\ v { v } _ { + }$ cations and $\\mathrm { v _ { \\mathrm { - } } }$ anions then its limiting molar conductivity is given by: \n\nHere, $\\lambda _ { + } ^ { ^ { \\circ } }$ and $\\lambda _ { - } ^ { ^ { \\circ } }$ are the limiting molar conductivities of the cation and anion respectively. The values of $\\lambda ^ { ^ { \\circ } }$ for some cations and anions at 298 K are given in Table 2.4. \n\nWeak Electrolytes \n\nWeak electrolytes like acetic acid have lower degree of dissociation at higher concentrations and hence for such electrolytes, the change in $\\varLambda _ { m }$ with dilution is due to increase in the degree of dissociation and consequently the number of ions in total volume of solution that contains $1 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }$ of electrolyte. In such cases $\\varLambda _ { m }$ increases steeply (Fig. 2.6) on dilution, especially near lower concentrations. Therefore, $\\hat { { \\cal A } } _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ cannot be obtained by extrapolation of $\\varLambda _ { m }$ to zero concentration. At infinite dilution (i.e., concentration $c  z e r o ]$ electrolyte dissociates completely $\\scriptstyle ( \\alpha = 1 )$ , but at such low concentration the conductivity of the solution is so low that it cannot be measured accurately. Therefore, $\\hat { { \\cal A } } _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ for weak electrolytes is obtained by using Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions (Example 2.8). At any concentration $c$ if $\\alpha$ is the degree of dissociation then it can be approximated to the ratio of molar conductivity $\\varLambda _ { m }$ at the concentration c to limiting molar conductivity, $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { 0 }$ . Thus we have: \n\nBut we know that for a weak electrolyte like acetic acid (Class XI, Unit 7, \n\nApplications of Kohlrausch law \n\nUsing Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions, it is possible to calculate $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { 0 }$ for any electrolyte from the $\\lambda ^ { \\mathrm { { o } } }$ of individual ions. Moreover, for weak electrolytes like acetic acid it is possible to determine the value of its dissociation constant once we know the $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { 0 }$ and $\\varLambda _ { m }$ at a given concentration c. \n\nExample 2.7 Calculate $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { 0 }$ for $\\mathrm { C a C l } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { { M g S O _ { 4 } } }$ from the data given in Table 3.4. \n\nSolution We know from Kohlrausch law that \n\nExample 2.8 $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { 0 }$ for Nac1, HCl and NaAc are 126.4, 425.9 and 91.0 S $\\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ respectively. Calculate $\\boldsymbol { \\Lambda } ^ { \\flat }$ for HAc. \n\nSolution \n\nExample 2.9 The conductivity of $\\mathrm { 0 . 0 0 1 0 2 8 \\ m o l \\ L ^ { - 1 } }$ acetic acid is $4 . 9 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \\mathrm { S \\ c m ^ { - 1 } }$ . Calculate its dissociation constant if $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { 0 }$ for acetic acid is $3 9 0 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { S \\ c m ^ { 2 } \\ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ . \n\n2.7 why does the conductivity of a solution decrease with dilution? \n\n2.8 Suggest a way to determine the $\\varLambda _ { m } ^ { \\circ }$ value of water. \n\n2.9 The molar conductivity of $0 . 0 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m o l ~ L ^ { - 1 } }$ methanoic acid is $4 6 . 1 \\mathrm { S } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ . Calculate its degree of dissociation and dissociation constant. Given $\\lambda ^ { 0 } ( \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } )$ (cid:) $= 3 4 9 . 6 \\ \\mathrm { S \\ c m ^ { 2 } \\ n o l ^ { - 1 } }$ and $\\lambda ^ { 0 } ( \\mathrm { H C O O ^ { - } } ) = 5 4 . 6 \\mathrm { ~ S ~ c m ^ { 2 } ~ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ . \n\n2.5 Electrolytic Cells and Electrolysis \n\nIn an electrolytic cell external source of voltage is used to bring about a chemical reaction. The electrochemical processes are of great importance in the laboratory and the chemical industry. One of the simplest electrolytic cell consists of two copper strips dipping in an aqueous solution of copper sulphate. If a DC voltage is applied to the two electrodes, then $\\mathrm { C u } ^ { \\bar { 2 } + }$ ions discharge at the cathode (negatively charged) and the follwing reaction takes place: \n\nCopper metal is deposited on the cathode. At the anode, copper is converted into $\\mathrm { { C u } ^ { 2 + } }$ ions by the reaction: \n\nThus copper is dissolved (oxidised) at anode and deposited (reduced) at cathode. This is the basis for an industrial process in which impure copper is converted into copper of high purity. The impure copper is made an anode that dissolves on passing current and pure copper is deposited at the cathode. Many metals like Na, Mg, Al, etc. are produced on large scale by electrochemical reduction of their respective cations where no suitable chemical reducing agents are available for this purpose. \n\nSodium and magnesium metals are produced by the electrolysis of their fused chlorides and aluminium is produced by electrolysis of aluminium oxide in presence of cryolite. \n\nQuantitative Aspects of Electrolysis \n\nMichael Faraday was the first scientist who described the quantitative aspects of electrolysis. Now Faraday's laws also flow from what has been discussed earlier. \n\nFaraday's Laws of Electrolysis \n\nAfter his extensive investigations on electrolysis of solutions and melts of electrolytes, Faraday published his results during 1833-34 in the form of the following well known Faraday's two laws of electrolysis: \n\n(i) First Law: The amount of chemical reaction which occurs at any electrode during electrolysis by a current is proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte (solution or melt).   \n(ii) Second Law: The amounts of different substances liberated by the same quantity of electricity passing through the electrolytic solution are proportional to their chemical equivalent weights (Atomic Mass of Metal $\\div$ Number of electrons required to reduce the cation). \n\nThere were no constant current sources available during Faraday's times. The general practice was to put a coulometer (a standard electrolytic cell) for determining the quantity of electricity passed from the amount of metal (generally silver or copper) deposited or consumed. However, coulometers are now obsolete and we now have constant current $\\left( I \\right)$ sources available and the quantity of electricity $Q$ , passed is given by \n\n$Q$ is in coloumbs when $I$ is in ampere and $t$ is in second. \n\nThe amount of electricity (or charge) required for oxidation or reduction depends on the stoichiometry of the electrode reaction. For example, in the reaction: \n\nOne mole of the electron is required for the reduction of one mole of silver ions. ▲ \n\nWe know that charge on one electron is equal to $1 . 6 0 2 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 1 9 } \\mathrm { C }$ \n\nTherefore, the charge on one mole of electrons is equal to: \n\nThis quantity of electricity is called Faraday and is represented by the symbol $\\mathbf { F }$ \n\nFor approximate calculations we use $1 { \\mathrm { F } } \\simeq 9 6 5 0 0 { \\mathrm { ~ C ~ m o l } } ^ { - 1 } .$ \n\nFor the electrode reactions: \n\nIt is obvious that one mole of $\\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ and ${ \\mathbb { A } } ^ { 3 + }$ require $2 \\mathrm { m o l }$ of electrons (2F) and $3 \\mathrm { m o l }$ of electrons (3F) respectively. The charge passed through the electrolytic cell during electrolysis is equal to the product of current in amperes and time in seconds. In commercial production of metals, current as high as 5o,ooo amperes are used that amounts to about 0.518 $\\mathrm { F }$ per second. - \n\nExample 2.10 \n\nA solution of $\\mathrm { C u S O _ { 4 } }$ is electrolysed for 10 minutes with a current of 1.5 amperes. what is the mass of copper deposited at the cathode? $t = 6 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { : }$ s charge $=$ current $\\times$ time = 1.5 A × 600 s = 900 C According to the reaction:   \n$\\mathrm { C u } ^ { 2 + } ( \\mathrm { a q } ) + 2 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - } = \\mathrm { C u } ( \\mathrm { s } )$   \nwe require 2F or $2 \\times 9 6 4 8 7 \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ to deposit $1 \\ \\mathrm { m o l }$ or $6 3 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ of Cu. For 9o0 C, the mass of Cu deposited   \n$= ( 6 3 ~ \\mathrm { g ~ m o l ^ { - 1 } ~ \\times ~ 9 0 0 ~ C } ) / ( 2 ~ \\times ~ 9 6 4 8 7 ~ \\mathrm { C ~ m o l ^ { - 1 } } ) ~ = ~ 0 . 2 9 3 8 ~ \\mathrm { g } .$ \n\n2.5.1 Products of Electrolysis \n\nProducts of electrolysis depend on the nature of material being electrolysed and the type of electrodes being used. If the electrode is inert (e.g., platinum or gold), it does not participate in the chemical reaction and acts only as source or sink for electrons. On the other hand, if the electrode is reactive, it participates in the electrode reaction. Thus, the products of electrolysis may be different for reactive and inert electrodes.The products of electrolysis depend on the different oxidising and reducing species present in the electrolytic cell and their standard electrode potentials. Moreover, some of the electrochemical processes although feasible, are so slow kinetically that at lower voltages these do not seem to take place and extra potential (called overpotential has to be applied, which makes such process more difficult to occur. \n\nFor example, if we use molten NaCl, the products of electrolysis are sodium metal and $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ gas. Here we have only one cation $\\boldsymbol { ( \\mathrm { N a ^ { + } ) } }$ which is reduced at the cathode $\\mathrm { ( N a ^ { + } + e ^ { - }  N a ) }$ and one anion (Cl) which is oxidised at the anode $\\mathrm { ( C l ^ { - }  ^ { 1 } 2 C l _ { 2 } + e ^ { - } }$ ). During the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride solution, the products are NaOH, $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ . In this case besides $\\mathrm { N a } ^ { + }$ and $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ ions we also have $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ and $\\mathrm { O H } ^ { - }$ ions along with the solvent molecules, $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ . \n\nAt the cathode there is competition between the following reduction reactions: \n\nThe reaction with higher value of $E ^ { \\scriptscriptstyle 0 }$ is preferred and therefore, the reaction at the cathode during electrolysis is: \n\nbut $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ (aq) is produced by the dissociation of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ i.e., \n\nTherefore, the net reaction at the cathode may be written as the sum of (2.33) and (2.34) and we have \n\nAt the anode the following oxidation reactions are possible: \n\nThe reaction at anode with lower value of $E ^ { \\circ }$ is preferred and therefore, water should get oxidised in preference to $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ (aq). However, on account of overpotential of oxygen, reaction (2.36) is preferred. Thus, the net reactions may be summarised as: \n\n$\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\mathrm { N a C l ~ ( a q ) ~ } \\xrightarrow { \\mathrm { H _ 2 O } } \\mathrm { ~ N a ~ } ^ { + } \\mathrm { ( a q ) ~ } + \\mathrm { C l } ^ { - } \\mathrm { ~ ( a q ) } } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { C a t h o d e } \\mathrm { : } \\qquad \\mathrm { H _ 2 O } \\mathrm { ( \\it l ) } + \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }  \\mathrm { \\it / { 2 } } \\mathrm { ~ H _ 2 ( \\mathrm { g } ) ~ } + \\mathrm { O H } ^ { - } \\mathrm { ~ ( a q ) } } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { A n o d e } \\mathrm { : } \\qquad \\mathrm { C l } ^ { - } \\mathrm { ~ ( a q ) }  \\mathrm { \\it / { 2 } ~ C l _ 2 ( \\mathrm { g } ) ~ } + \\mathrm { ~ e } ^ { - } } \\end{array}$ Net reaction: $\\mathrm { { N a C l } ( a q ) + H _ { 2 } O ( \\mathit { l } ) \\to \\mathrm { N a } ^ { + } ( a q ) + O H ^ { - } ( a q ) + ^ { 1 } / 2 H _ { 2 } ( g ) + ^ { 1 } / 2 C l _ { 2 } ( g ) }$ \n\nThe standard electrode potentials are replaced by electrode potentials given by Nernst equation (Eq. 2.8) to take into account the concentration effects. During the electrolysis of sulphuric acid, the following processes are possible at the anode: \n\nFor dilute sulphuric acid, reaction (2.38) is preferred but at higher concentrations of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ , reaction (2.39) is preferred. \n\nIntext Questions \n\n2.10 If a current of 0.5 ampere flows through a metallic wire for 2 hours, then how many electrons would flow through the wire? \n\n2.11 Suggest a list of metals that are extracted electrolytically. \n\n2.12 Consider the reaction: $\\mathrm { C r _ { 2 } O _ { 7 } } ^ { 2 - } + 1 4 \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } + 6 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }  2 \\mathrm { C r } ^ { 3 + } + 7 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ \n\nwhat is the quantity of electricity in coulombs needed to reduce 1 mol of $\\mathrm { C r } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 7 } { } ^ { 2 - } ?$ (cid:) \n\n2.6 Batteries \n\nAny battery (actually it may have one or more than one cell connected in series) or cell that we use as a source of electrical energy is basically a galvanic cell where the chemical energy of the redox reaction is converted into electrical energy. However, for a battery to be of practical use it should be reasonably light, compact and its voltage should not vary appreciably during its use. There are mainly two types of batteries. \n\n2.6.1 Primary Batteries \n\nCarbon rod (cathode) \n\nIn the primary batteries, the reaction occurs only once and after use   \nover a period of time battery becomes dead and cannot be reused again. The most familiar example of this type is the dry cell (known as Leclanche cell after its discoverer) which is used commonly in our transistors and clocks. The cell consists of a zinc container that also acts as anode and the cathode is a carbon (graphite) rod surrounded by powdered manganese dioxide and carbon (Fig.2.8). The space between the electrodes is filled by a moist paste of ammonium chloride $\\mathrm { ( N H } _ { 4 } \\mathrm { C l ) }$ and zinc chloride $\\mathrm { ( Z n C l _ { 2 } ) }$ .The electrode reactions are complex, but they can be written approximately as follows : \n\nAnode: $\\mathrm { Z n ( s ) \\longrightarrow Z n ^ { 2 + } + 2 e ^ { - } }$ \n\nCathode: $\\mathrm { M n O _ { 2 } ^ { + } \\Delta N H _ { 4 } ^ { + } { } ^ { + } \\ e ^ { - } \\longrightarrow M n O ( O H ) + N H _ { 3 } }$ \n\nIn the reaction at cathode, manganese is reduced from the $^ \\mathrm { ~ + ~ 4 ~ }$ oxidation state to the $+ 3$ state. Ammonia produced in the reaction forms a complex with $Z \\mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ to give $\\mathrm { [ Z n \\ ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 4 } ] ^ { 2 + } }$ . The cell has a potential of nearly $1 . 5 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ (i \n\nMercury cell, (Fig. 2.9) suitable for low current devices like hearing aids, watches, etc. consists of zinc – mercury amalgam as anode and a paste of $\\mathrm { H g O }$ and carbon as the cathode. The electrolyte is a paste of KOH and $Z \\mathrm { n O }$ . The electrode reactions for the cell are given below: \n\nAnode: $Z n ( H \\mathrm { g } ) + 2 \\mathrm { O H } ^ { - } \\longrightarrow \\mathrm { Z n O ( s ) } + \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } + 2 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }$ Cathode: (cid:) $\\mathrm { H g O } + \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } + 2 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - } \\longrightarrow \\mathrm { H g ( l ) } + 2 \\mathrm { O H } ^ { - }$ \n\n2.6.2 Secondary Batteries \n\nThe overall reaction is represented by \n\nThe cell potential is approximately $1 . 3 5 \\mathrm { V }$ and remains constant during its life as the overall reaction does not involve any ion in solution whose concentration can change during its life time. \n\nA secondary cell after use can be recharged by passing current through it in the opposite direction so that it can be used again. A good secondary cell can undergo a large number of discharging and charging cycles. The most important secondary cell is the lead storage battery (Fig. 2.10) commonly used in automobiles and invertors. It consists of a lead anode and a grid of lead packed with lead dioxide $\\mathrm { ( P b O _ { 2 } }$ ) as cathode. A $3 8 \\%$ solution of sulphuric acid is used as an electrolyte. \n\nThe cell reactions when the battery is in use are given below: \n\nAnode: $\\mathrm { P b } ( \\mathrm { s } ) + \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } ^ { 2 - } ( \\mathrm { a q } )  \\mathrm { P b } \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } ( \\mathrm { s } ) + 2 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }$ \n\n.e., overall cell reaction consisting of cathode and anode reactions is: \n\nOn charging the battery the reaction is reversed and $\\mathrm { P b S O _ { 4 } ( s ) }$ on anode and cathode is converted into $\\mathrm { P b }$ and $\\mathrm { P b } { \\cal O } _ { 2 }$ , respectively. \n\nAnother important secondary cell is the nickel-cadmium cell (Fig. 2.1 1) which has longer life than the lead storage cell but more expensive to manufacture. We shall not go into details of working of the cell and the electrode reactions during charging and discharging. The overall reaction during discharge is: \n\n2.7 fuel Cells \n\nProduction of electricity by thermal plants is not a very efficient method and is a major source of pollution. In such plants, the chemical energy (heat of combustion) of fossil fuels (coal, gas or oil) is first used for converting water into high pressure steam. This is then used to run a turbine to produce electricity. We know that a galvanic cell directly converts chemical energy into electricity and is highly efficient. It is now possible to make such cells in which reactants are fed continuously to the electrodes and products are removed continuously from the electrolyte compartment. Galvanic cells that are designed to convert the energy of combustion of fuels like hydrogen, methane, methanol, etc. directly into electrical energy are called fuel cells. \n\nOne of the most successful fuel cells uses the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to form water (Fig. 2.12). The cell was used for providing electrical power in the Apollo space programme. The water vapours produced during the reaction were condensed and added to the drinking water supply for the astronauts. In the cell, hydrogen and oxygen are bubbled through porous carbon electrodes into concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. Catalysts like finely divided platinum or palladium metal are incorporated into the electrodes for increasing the rate of electrode reactions. The electrode reactions are \n\ngiven below: \n\nOverall reaction being: $\\mathrm { 2 H _ { 2 } ( g ) + O _ { 2 } ( g ) \\longrightarrow 2 H _ { 2 } O ( l ) }$ \n\nThe cell runs continuously as long as the reactants are supplied. Fuel cells produce electricity with an efficiency of about $7 0 \\%$ compared to thermal plants whose efficiency is about $4 0 \\%$ . There has been tremendous progress in the development of new electrode materials, better catalysts and electrolytes for increasing the efficiency of fuel cells. These have been used in automobiles on an experimental basis. Fuel cells are pollution free and in view of their future importance, a variety of fuel cells have been fabricated and tried. \n\nOxidation: Fe $( \\mathbf { s } ) $ (cid:) $\\mathrm { F e ^ { 2 + } }$ (aq) $+ 2 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }$   \nReduction: $\\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } ( \\mathrm { g } ) + 4 \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } ( \\mathrm { a q } ) + 4 \\mathrm { e } ^ { - }  2 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } ( \\mathrm { l } )$   \nAtomospheric   \noxidation: $2 \\mathrm { F e ^ { 2 + } ( a q ) } + 2 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O ( l ) } + \\mathrm { \\downarrow } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { ( g ) }  \\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { ( s ) } + \\mathrm { 4 H ^ { + } ( a q ) }$ \n\nCorrosion slowly coats the surfaces of metallic objects with oxides or other salts of the metal. The rusting of iron, tarnishing of silver, development of green coating on copper and bronze are some of the examples of corrosion. It causes enormous damage to buildings, bridges, ships and to all objects made of metals especially that of iron. We lose crores of rupees every year on account of corrosion. \n\nIn corrosion, a metal is oxidised by loss of electrons to oxygen and formation of oxides. Corrosion of iron (commonly known as rusting) occurs in presence of water and air. The chemistry of corrosion is quite complex but it may be considered essentially as an electrochemical phenomenon. At a particular spot (Fig. 2.13) of an object made of iron, oxidation takes place and that spot behaves as anode and we can write the reaction \n\nElectrons released at anodic spot move through the metal and go to another spot on the metal and reduce oxygen in the presence of $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ (which is believed to be available from $\\mathrm { { H _ { 2 } C O _ { 3 } } }$ formed due to dissolution of carbon dioxide from air into water. Hydrogen ion in water may also be available due to dissolution of other acidic oxides from the atmosphere). This spot behaves as cathode with the reaction \n\nThe overall reaction being: \n\nThe ferrous ions are further oxidised by atmospheric oxygen to ferric ions which come out as rust in the form of hydrated ferric oxide $( \\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 } . \\ x \\ \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } )$ and with further production of hydrogen ions. \n\nPrevention of corrosion is of prime importance. It not only saves money but also helps in preventing accidents such as a bridge collapse or failure of a key component due to corrosion. One of the simplest methods of preventing corrosion is to prevent the surface of the metallic object to come in contact with atmosphere. This can be done by covering the surface with paint or by some chemicals (e.g. bisphenol). Another simple method is to cover the surface by other metals (Sn, Zn, etc.) that are inert or react to save the object. An electrochemical method is to provide a sacrificial electrode of another metal (like Mg, Zn, etc.) which corrodes itself but saves the object. \n\nIntext Questions \n\n2.13 Write the chemistry of recharging the lead storage battery, highlighting all the materials that are involved during recharging. \n\n2.14 Suggest two materials other than hydrogen that can be used as fuels in fuel cells. \n\n2.15 Explain how rusting of iron is envisaged as setting up of an electrochemical cell. \n\nThe Hydrogen Economy \n\nAt present the main source of energy that is driving our economy is fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. As more people on the planet aspire to improve their standard of living, their energy requirement will increase. In fact, the per capita consumption of energy used is a measure of development. Of course, it is assumed that energy is used for productive purpose and not merely wasted. We are already aware that carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil fuels is resulting in the 'Greenhouse Effect'. This is leading to a rise in the temperature of the Earth's surface, causing polar ice to melt and ocean levels to rise. This will flood low-lying areas along the coast and some island nations such as Maldives face total submergence. In order to avoid such a catastrope, we need to limit our use of carbonaceous fuels. Hydrogen provides an ideal alternative as its combustion results in water only. Hydrogen production must come from splitting water using solar energy. Therefore, hydrogen can be used as a renewable and non polluting source of energy. This is the vision of the Hydrogen Economy. Both the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water and hydrogen combustion in a fuel cell will be important in the future. And both these technologies are based on electrochemical principles. \n\nSummary \n\nAn electrochemical cell consists of two metalic electrodes dipping in electrolytic solution(s). Thus an important component of the electrochemical cell is the ionic conductor or electrolyte. Electrochemical cells are of two types. In galvanic cell, the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical work, whereas in an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to carry out a nonspontaneous redox reaction. The standard electrode potential for any electrode dipping in an appropriate solution is defined with respect to standard electrode potential of hydrogen electrode taken as zero. The standard potential of the cell an $\\ : [ \\ : E _ { \\mathrm { ( c e l l ) } } ^ { \\mathrm { o } } \\ : = \\ : E ^ { \\mathrm { o } } \\ :$ catie $E ^ { 0 }$ related to standard Gibbs energy $( \\Delta _ { r } G ^ { \\mathrm { o } } ~ = ~ - n F E _ { \\mathrm { ( c e l l ) } } ^ { \\mathrm { o } } )$ and equilibrium constant $( \\Delta _ { r } G ^ { \\mathrm { o } } = - \\ R T \\ln \\ K )$ of the reaction taking place in the cell. Concentration dependence of the potentials of the electrodes and the cells are given by Nernst equation. \n\nThe conductivity, $\\kappa ,$ of an electrolytic solution depends on the concentration of the electrolyte, nature of solvent and temperature. Molar conductivity, $\\varLambda _ { m }$ ,is defined by $\\quad = \\ \\kappa / c$ where $c$ is the concentration. Conductivity decreases but molar conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. It increases slowly with decrease in concentration for strong electrolytes while the increase is very steep for weak electrolytes in very dilute solutions. Kohlrausch found that molar conductivity at infinite dilution, for an electrolyte is sum of the contribution of the molar conductivity of the ions in which it dissociates. It is known as law of independent migration of ions and has many applications. Ions conduct electricity through the solution but oxidation and reduction of the ions take place at the electrodes in an electrochemical cell. Batteries and fuel cells are very useful forms of galvanic cell. Corrosion of metals is essentially an electrochemical phenomenon. Electrochemical principles are relevant to the Hydrogen Economy. \n\n2.1 Arrange the following metals in the order in which they displace each other from the solution of their salts.
